LIAR LION

3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>Liar Lion</i>.

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:02,562
"Once upon a time, there lived a liar lion
in the faraway Lion Land."

5
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,610
"The lion had the most beautiful mane."

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,865
"All the other lions were jealous
of his magnificent mane."

7
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,784
It looks so cool.

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,456
"But the lion had a big secret."

9
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,582
What could it be?

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,376
"His mane was fake."

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,420
It was fake.

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:35,094
"The fake mane made him uncomfortable
and hurt his head,

13
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,432
but he put up with it
because he didn't want to take it off."

14
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>"The lion blamed his mom and dad</i>
<i>for not giving him a nice mane."</i>

<i>"'This is my mane.</i>
<i>I have the coolest mane in the world.'"</i>

EPISODE 12: 💞 kissasian.one 💞

18
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,050
Mom.

19
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,595
Yu-jeong.

20
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,858
I thought you might not wake up.

21
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,320
I was terrified.

22
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,407
I had a good sleep.

23
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,408
Yeah.

24
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,952
I feel refreshed.

25
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,870
Yes.

26
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,085
Why are you crying?

27
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,343
My In-su.

28
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,969
You're a crybaby, aren't you?

29
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,184
What's wrong?

30
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,769
Don't cry.

31
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,481
Why are you crying?

32
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,700
Don't cry, In-su.

33
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,953
You have three grown sons.

34
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,918
You're a crybaby.

35
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,675
Yeah.

36
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,610
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

37
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,688
Drink some water and have some food.

38
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:18,484
If your mother saw you drinking like this,
she would chew you out.

39
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,430
She said when she felt better…

40
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,643
she'd go to your salon
to get her hair done.

41
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:58,357
She said she picked out
the best ones she had.

42
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,320
This is so like her.

43
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,365
She just loved giving out things
in envelopes.

44
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,953
She kept asking

45
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,750
what if she never got a chance

46
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,045
to apologize to you.

47
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,341
If she wanted to,
she should've apologized.

48
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,760
She could've gotten her hair done

49
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,679
and thrown money in an envelope.

50
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,518
She should've come to see
the girl she hated one last time.

{\an8}JEWELRY FOR BOK-JA

52
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,999
I've never seen Dad cry before.

53
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,545
I've never heard him call Mom by her name.

54
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,465
I've never seen him fight.

55
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,182
Come in. Your mom is asking for you.

56
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,146
Mom.

57
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,360
I saved the last episode
of <i>Ppong-sik's Family</i> to watch with you.

58
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,821
I would feel betrayed
if you had watched it.

59
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,573
Let me see you.

60
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,535
Goodness, why is your hair so disheveled?

61
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,830
You seem to have lost a lot of weight
because of me.

62
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,709
Are you all right?

63
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,252
Does it hurt anywhere?

64
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,046
I'm okay. Perfectly fine.

65
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,725
My dear boys.

66
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,727
Have you eaten?

67
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
Kim Jeong-heon.

68
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,293
Jeong-heon!

69
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,213
Cancel everything on my schedule.
I want to take a break.

70
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,674
You go MIA for days,
and now you want to do what?

71
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,385
Are you actually going to retire?

72
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,346
No.

73
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,431
What then?

74
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,933
Hibernate?

75
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,481
When I wake up in the spring,
I'll think about it.

76
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,900
What are you, a frog?

77
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,194
No, a raccoon.

78
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,572
Seriously though.

79
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,743
In the past few years,
I've never even taken a week off.

80
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,578
Not even a full day, actually.

81
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,330
You know that better than anyone.

82
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,757
Ms. Ma.

83
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,095
I know I'm making things hard for you.

84
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,680
Then why are you doing this?

85
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,473
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

86
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,978
So cut me some slack, Mi-ra.

87
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,943
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

88
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,570
Oh, hey!

89
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,072
- Hey, how are you?
- Great, thanks.

90
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,574
How's your show going?

91
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,117
Okay, I guess.

92
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,328
By the way, is Min-gu working with you?

93
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,955
Yeah, why?

94
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,749
Well, my assistant called it quits,
so I called him,

95
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
but he said he wasn't available.

96
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,712
We're planning a show together.

97
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,005
I see.

98
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,843
Listen. I hear Min-gu works
as a chauffeur on the side now.

99
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,720
What?

100
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm sorry to ask you this,

101
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,849
but if you're still in the planning stage,

102
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,269
could he join our team for a few months
with additional pay?

103
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,563
When your show gets slotted,
I'll send him back.

104
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,902
Wow, cool.

105
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,239
- Let me see what else it can do.
- This is amazing.

106
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,991
- It's so pretty.
- Hi, Woo-ju.

107
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,451
Oh, hello.

108
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,952
Hey.

109
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,164
Oh, you got coffee. Thank you.

110
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,832
Thank you.

111
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,335
Woo-ju, check this out.

112
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,253
- This would be good for games.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,755
You should try it too.

114
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,478
OUR CAPTAIN

115
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,105
Our captain.

116
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,155
Want me to remove it?

117
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,073
No.

118
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,158
It's cool.

119
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,579
I-na. Let's get to work.

120
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,622
Okay.

121
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,919
You guys are fired.

122
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,046
What?

123
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,965
I broke the only rule of our team.

124
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,342
Therefore, we're disbanding.

125
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,053
What's the rule of our team?

126
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,472
Min-gu, you tell her.

127
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,767
We don't work for unfair wages.

128
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,104
But that's just until production starts.

129
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,855
I heard you have a part-time job.

130
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,818
And I-na's probably
in a similar situation.

131
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,322
You two must be getting lots of offers,
but you don't want me to feel bad.

132
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,282
It's not like that, Woo-ju.

133
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,458
Go eat and then go home.
Don't come back here.

134
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm really glad to hear about your mother.

135
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,891
Thank you.

136
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,645
You must be feeling better.
Can you focus on work now?

137
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,272
Yes.

138
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,858
Ki-baek.

139
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,903
I don't need to tell you
how important this time is for you, right?

140
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,625
I LOVE NEWS!

141
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,172
You asked me before if you could do
news shows as a freelancer.

142
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,968
Right. I did.

143
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,681
Do you still want to host news shows?

144
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,729
I'm surprised
Ms. Ma is letting you do news shows.

145
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,857
It's not an authentic news show.
It's a casual thing.

146
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,568
Still, the format is the same, isn't it?

147
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,698
What's wrong?
You were dying to do a news show.

148
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,617
Yeah, I was.

149
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,619
I thought it'd kill me
if I couldn't do it.

150
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,329
No, it won't kill you.

151
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,288
It won't.

152
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,416
Are you embarrassed?

153
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,087
Because it feels like you're sniffing
around it again after kicking it away?

154
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,216
Tell me. Why are you hesitating?

155
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,053
I'm not. I already gave her my answer.

156
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,555
So you told her you'd do it?

157
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,392
<i>I don't want to do a news show.</i>

158
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,689
I'm not going to.

159
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:42,446
I actually did some research on you.
But this is unexpected.

160
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:49,745
I'm not the same person I used to be.

161
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,500
A lot has happened
since you quit your last job, right?

162
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,920
Yes. So many things have happened.

163
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,800
Still, I'm curious
because you sound so certain.

164
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,889
<i>I thought it'd make me look successful.</i>

165
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,684
I thought being seated
at the heart of the news desk

166
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,355
would prove that I was a successful man.

167
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:21,151
That's why you were obsessed with it?
Like it'd kill you if you didn't do it?

168
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,407
Whenever people talked me up
and said I had it all,

169
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,117
you have no idea how anxious I was.

170
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,828
The truth is, I've got nothing.

171
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,416
I've lived my whole life
hiding behind a flashy mask.

172
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:40,379
Look, everyone wears a mask. Who doesn't?

173
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,257
Unless you get struck by lightning
and lose your mind.

174
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,262
Luckily, I was struck by lightning
straight through.

175
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,764
What?

176
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,225
I thought I was going to go down for sure,

177
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,519
but I didn't.

178
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,773
<i>It actually made me happy and smile more.</i>

179
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,903
I thought,
Man, have I really gone insane?

180
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,034
Still, hosting a news show
was your dream.

181
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,202
It was my dream.

182
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,871
Actually,

183
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,874
it still is.

184
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:24,840
My real dream is to report
the truth to the world and be honest.

185
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,843
That's what makes me happy.
I've realized that now.

186
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,887
Then why did you turn it down?

187
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,759
You're home.

188
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,843
Yeah.

189
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,684
Is Yeong-won okay?

190
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,603
Of course not.

191
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,606
He's your boyfriend.
Shouldn't you be with him?

192
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,320
A middle-aged man's girlfriend
staying at his mother's funeral all day?

193
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,197
It could make some people gossip.

194
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,950
Why would you worry about that?

195
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,326
I don't.

196
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,663
My makeup got smudged.
I'm going to fix myself up and go back.

197
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,295
Does Yeong-won…

198
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,590
talk to you about getting married?

199
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,177
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

200
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,638
Did you have dinner?

201
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,890
I just grabbed something small.

202
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,693
What?

203
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,321
- Why do you have fried chicken?
- You said you didn't eat.

204
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,699
How sweet of you.

205
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,084
I didn't have an appetite, but the chicken
my boyfriend got me sure tastes good.

206
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,629
What made you lose…

207
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,508
What's the matter, Woo-ju?

208
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,470
Do you want to get married?

209
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,557
What? Wait… If we…

210
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,894
What comes to your mind
when you hear that?

211
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,690
I think about how much I love you,
and I feel some sense of responsibility.

212
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,568
I feel like we'd be able to get through
anything together--

213
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,778
My mom.

214
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,741
That my mom would have to live
by herself without me.

215
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,205
I'm sure my mom would
think about me first too.

216
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,248
Is your mother

217
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,876
getting married?

218
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,923
What? Does she think
I'm going to stop her if she wants to?

219
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,925
She's so old-fashioned.

220
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,018
My mom and I are a little different
from other moms and daughters.

221
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,814
We saved each other's lives.

222
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,362
We wouldn't have survived
if we didn't have each other.

223
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,408
You appear to be
an ordinary mom and daughter duo.

224
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,957
I don't know
what my mom wants to do exactly.

225
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,769
You said you shouldn't hide anything
from the person you love.

226
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,062
That you shouldn't have to.

227
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,691
Try being honest with her first.

228
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,154
Thanks to someone, I tried that,
and it's not that difficult.

229
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,420
- Are you going back to work soon?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

230
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,422
Gu-won, you must be sad.

231
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,551
Nope. You have no idea how much she nags.

232
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,555
Mom, I want you to work. Really.

233
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,517
You wouldn't leave my side at home.

234
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,270
That's because
I thought you might be bored.

235
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,980
You hurt my feelings.

236
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,565
Give me my phone. Use yours.

237
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,735
But mine is for kids, and it's no fun.

238
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,905
Mom, will you buy me a new phone? Please?

239
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,073
You are a kid.

240
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,825
Oh, Mom.

241
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,411
I won't play with you anymore then.

242
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,246
Hang out with your friends instead.

243
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,082
I have no friends.
I'm going to hang out with you.

244
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,710
You bug me.

245
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,922
Give me back my phone!

246
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,632
Don't go through stuff.

247
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,718
Stay for lunch. I made dumplings.

248
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,719
Okay.

249
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,191
{\an8}CAPTAIN YEON

250
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,194
Hello.

251
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
WANT TO HANG OUT?
MADAME ON

252
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,746
What? Gu-won…

253
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,081
God.

254
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,751
I'm sorry. Gu-won pulled a prank.

255
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,836
Oh, I see.

256
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,426
Well, then I should go.

257
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,430
- You need a haircut.
- Sorry?

258
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,431
Have a seat.

259
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:08,892
Goodness.

260
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,691
It's dangerous if you move,
so stay put, okay?

261
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,694
We'll go have some dumplings.

262
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,118
I got some nice new machines,

263
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,537
but you haven't been coming to the gym.

264
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,749
Because you always
make me do difficult stuff.

265
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,252
Well, Yeon.

266
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,879
You just don't have muscles.

267
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,215
You're all skin and bones.

268
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,218
But, Un-baek,

269
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,388
you said I was cute.

270
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,347
Oh, you are…

271
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,475
still cute, of course.

272
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,230
Then, when we're done here…

273
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,902
do you want to hang out?

274
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,533
Sure. I'd love to.

275
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,192
<i>Are you busy?</i>

276
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,527
<i>Yeah.</i>

277
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,780
<i>I'm busy too.</i>

278
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,907
<i>So what?</i>

279
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,245
<i>How about a drink?</i>

280
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,914
<i>No.</i>

281
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,791
<i>Are you upset?</i>

282
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,751
<i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,671
LET'S HAVE SOME KAOLIANG LIQUOR

284
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,608
<i>Oh, for God's sake!</i>

285
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,026
<i>It's just your bad luck.</i>

286
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,910
Mom.

287
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,537
Yeah?

288
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,289
If Yeong-won wants to get married,

289
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,415
you should.

290
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,669
I know you like him a lot.

291
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,423
What's with all this marriage talk
all of a sudden?

292
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,094
I'm too old to get married now.
It's gross.

293
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,430
You didn't get to do anything in
your twenties and thirties because of me.

294
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,599
You should date and get married.

295
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,643
Do whatever you want to do.

296
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,354
There's nothing I want to do. I'm done.

297
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,982
I'm happy with my life now.

298
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,317
Nothing to complain about.

299
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,658
Why are you always happy with everything?

300
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,742
Listen to you.

301
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,163
You're on another level of crazy today.

302
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,249
Everything you've done
is to make things easier for me.

303
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,668
There's nothing you want to do?
That can't be true.

304
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,420
Why would you lie?

305
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,425
Do you think I wasn't prepared to do that
when I took you in?

306
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,887
You saved my life,
so I knew I had to give you a better one.

307
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,307
I thought making you happy
would make me feel like

308
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,560
I'd done at least
one good thing in my life.

309
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,603
Satisfied?

310
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:45,650
That's exactly why I can't do anything
but smile in front of you.

311
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,488
Because I feel like I can't be unhappy.

312
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,616
What?

313
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,370
What's the matter with you?

314
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,831
You weren't even like this as a teenager.

315
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,542
I should've just
told you everything back then.

316
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,212
You and I were both being foolish.

317
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,838
So what? Are you going to run away?

318
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,674
Mom, I'm being serious here.
Why would you say that?

319
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,761
What should I say then?
"I'm sorry I lived my life that way"?

320
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,638
"I didn't realize how you felt"?

321
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,556
That's not what I'm saying.

322
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,897
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

323
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,287
Hey.

324
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,964
Things look different…

325
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,217
You got rid of most of the liquor.

326
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,975
All the locks are gone.

327
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,685
Good for you.

328
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
Let's drink.

329
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,106
Here?

330
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,108
Where else?

331
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,906
Can I go in there?

332
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,663
Wow, so you've got
absolutely nothing in here.

333
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,582
Did you think there'd be a safe
or something?

334
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,460
Having nothing.

335
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,422
That's the biggest secret indeed.

336
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,929
Should I start up a business?

337
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,306
What?

338
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,434
"Fried chicken
made by your ideal son-in-law." No.

339
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,314
"Noodles made by your ideal son-in-law."
Don't you think that might work?

340
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,152
But perhaps,
no one would call me that now.

341
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,903
You're being ridiculous.

342
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,324
I've watched my dad's businesses fail
my whole life.

343
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,034
It's not for everybody.

344
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,619
Then what should I do with my life now?

345
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,667
Do you know what the funny part is?

346
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,296
I was the one who walked away
from everything,

347
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,965
but I still found myself
watching my shows.

348
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,886
It's absurd, isn't it? Why do I care?

349
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,805
Because you like your job.

350
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,810
I got panic disorder doing what I like.
Who would understand that?

351
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,021
So what if no one does?

352
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,149
Would that make you not like it anymore
or make your problems go away?

353
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,653
Stop thinking about others
and get better first.

354
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,200
After that, you can sell fried chicken
or noodles or whatever.

355
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,202
I'm going to make a comeback.

356
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,122
When I'm all better,

357
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,625
I'm going to do what I like again.

358
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,545
If you've already made your decision,
why did you even ask?

359
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,632
I just wanted to whine about it
to a friend, okay?

360
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,934
If I do what I like
and fall flat on my face,

361
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,521
can I come and whine about it too?

362
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,272
I like it here.

363
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:23,993
MY WOO-JU

364
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,412
<i>I ran away from home.</i>

365
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,790
I've got to go deal with
a runaway delinquent.

366
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,585
Huh? Do you patrol your neighborhood now
or something?

367
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,629
It's a special operation.

368
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,813
You scared me.

369
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,815
Drinking alcohol
and running away from home?

370
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,983
I should arrest you.

371
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,818
Have you been drinking too?

372
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,738
Yeah. A little.

373
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,407
That's good.

374
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,952
It would've been embarrassing
if you were sober.

375
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:12,041
Why did my delinquent adult Ms. On Woo-ju
run away from home so late at night?

376
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,086
I had a fight with my mom.

377
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,007
You did? Tell me what happened.

378
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,802
Well, it wasn't exactly a fight.

379
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,014
I just got upset
and took it out on her, I guess.

380
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,060
I've never lashed out at her before,

381
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,065
but guess what? It felt really good.

382
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,194
It's all so embarrassing.

383
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,529
How do I go home and face her? Man.

384
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,242
Here's how.

385
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,163
You'll play on the swing while drunk,
hang out with your boyfriend for a while,

386
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,706
and then go home.

387
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,665
Yeah?

388
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,800
I know you're feeling down,
but can I tell you some good news?

389
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,718
Oh, yeah. What is it?

390
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,307
I'm going to give it a try.

391
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,103
My dream that I haven't given up.

392
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,730
I think I can do it now.

393
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,985
Thanks to somebody,
now I have the courage to try.

394
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,031
I hope your dream comes true, Ki-baek.

395
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,534
Wish me luck.

396
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,285
Good luck.

397
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,167
- Can you push a little harder?
- All right.

398
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,335
Harder?

399
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,254
Hold on tight.

400
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,050
<i>What do you mean?</i>

401
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,098
<i>Father is quite angry.</i>

402
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,102
God, I'm hungry.

403
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,687
I'm starving.

404
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,857
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>You should come with me.</i>

405
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,444
You mean girl. You get me all upset
and crawl in at this hour?

406
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,321
Well…

407
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,447
That's right.

408
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,909
Raising you, I kept myself from

409
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,996
doing what I wanted
to give you your best chance. So what?

410
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,083
Well, I'm just saying
you shouldn't do that anymore.

411
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:21,629
I chose to do that, just like how
I'm choosing to live my life this way now.

412
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,840
Who are you to tell me to date
or get married?

413
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,260
- You're lying.
- Did you say I'm lying?

414
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,803
- Lying?
- Ouch.

415
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,264
I thought you were finally growing up.

416
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,099
Why are you acting like a teenager?

417
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:39,981
I just want you to do all the things
you want to do from now on.

418
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,067
Look at that.

419
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,281
He hasn't even mentioned marriage.

420
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,700
- So who am I supposed to marry?
- What?

421
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,327
Myself?

422
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,287
He hasn't proposed?

423
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,205
No.

424
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,498
No way!

425
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,044
What?

426
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,090
It's heavy. Take it easy.

427
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,346
- I'm off.
- Jeong-heon, wait.

428
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,431
Are you sure you'll be okay?

429
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,016
Why wouldn't I be?

430
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,478
Tomorrow, your panic disorder and hiatus
will be all over the news.

431
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,814
That was my idea.

432
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,692
Exactly. I'm asking
if you're really okay with that.

433
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,070
Take good care of my fan club.

434
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,196
I'll see you.

435
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,240
When will you be back?
You bought a one-way ticket.

436
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,283
I don't know.

437
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,910
Jeong-heon!

438
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,998
I'll miss you.

439
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,918
- You're being gross.
- I am.

440
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,047
Bye.

441
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,676
Take care of yourself!

442
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,649
{\an8}I HAVE THE BEST DAD

443
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,734
Let's get started.

444
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,652
Okay.

445
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,533
Hello, everyone.

446
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,371
Welcome to <i>EHGS</i>, <i>Eat Healthy, Get Strong</i>.

447
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,956
I'm Yoon Ji-hu.

448
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,006
I'll dig right in.

449
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,843
Boy, this looks delicious.

450
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,357
Here's an egg.

451
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,110
A tomato.

452
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,121
COUPLE'S PARADISE
THE FIRST LOVE

453
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,164
Oh, right.

454
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,167
Yes. I see.

455
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,127
Right.

456
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,591
All right, Chief.

457
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,968
I understand. Bye.

458
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,727
Oh, my God!

459
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,191
Wait a minute.

460
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,404
This is too embarrassing.

461
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,741
COUPLE'S PARADISE 2
LOOKING FOR NEWCOMERS

462
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,918
You guys are being silly,
and it's killing me.

463
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,337
Come on, let me call Woo-ju.

464
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,507
- Don't.
- What do you want to do then?

465
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,135
Let's just wait. Woo-ju is not an idiot.

466
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,097
It's like you don't know her at all.

467
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,390
She's been like that for over a decade.

468
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,768
People don't change so easily.

469
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,149
What?

470
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,693
Yeon. Ha-young.

471
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,155
I need your help.

472
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,661
<i>Laundry Therapy</i>. I really want to do this,
but I've got nothing.

473
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,163
I acted all tough
in front of Min-gu and I-na.

474
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,958
I sent them home
when they offered to help.

475
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,587
But I have to do this.
I really think I can.

476
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,714
The chief came by earlier.

477
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,509
- What?
- She told you to get things started.

478
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,427
You heard?

479
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,723
I've been waiting for you to come
and beg for my help.

480
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,892
Would that be okay?

481
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,436
I mean, you're the head writer
of<i> Couple's Paradise</i>.

482
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,689
I already passed it on
to Kim So-jeong's team.

483
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,940
What?

484
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,317
You didn't come to us

485
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,528
even when you were about to drown.

486
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,655
We were mad at you for that,
so we waited.

487
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,448
You quit the show too?

488
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,367
That's right, I did.

489
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,994
Guys.

490
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,374
Hi, I'm here for a job interview.

491
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,712
Min-gu. I-na.

492
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,340
I'm sorry.

493
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,968
I shouldn't have done that.

494
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,179
- We're family.
- Get a hold of yourselves.

495
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,638
This is the beginning.

496
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,767
If we don't get better ratings than
<i>Couple's Paradise</i>, our lives will be hell.

497
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,353
Doing laundry is not my thing though.

498
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,731
I even dry-clean my cotton T-shirts.

499
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,149
What?

500
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,735
How about<i> Dry-Clean Therapy </i>instead?

501
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,653
Sure. Anything you say.

502
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,489
I'll wash that foul mouth of yours too.

503
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,659
I'm meeting with Sinsang Electronics
tomorrow.

504
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,869
Okay.

505
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,080
- We'll need two mobile laundry trucks.
- That's right.

506
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,541
I-na and Min-gu,
draw up a list for casting.

507
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,585
- All right.
- All right, got it.

508
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,922
I promise I'll do a really good job.

509
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,590
Obviously.

510
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,550
Everyone on our team is good at their job.

511
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
Sparta!

512
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,511
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

513
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,388
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

514
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,641
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

515
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,601
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

516
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,271
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

517
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,819
Thank you.

518
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,457
This is for the website and PR material.

519
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,959
All right, let's start.

520
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,628
One, two, three.

521
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,340
Let's try a different pose.

522
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,008
Nice.

523
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,511
All right. Yeah, that's good.

524
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:53,104

00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,293

Now cheer!

539
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,068
You know we're Yu-jeong's VIP clients,
don't you?

540
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,403
Oh, yes. Thank you.

541
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,990
While you're here,
take some pictures and sing with us.

542
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,575
Sure, of course.

543
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,535
Let me know if there's a product you need.

544
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,915
All right. Let's sell these out today!

545
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,918
Can I take a picture with you?

546
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
He looks good in pictures too!

547
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,177
Go on. All right, take pictures.

548
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,888
Goodness, you're going to tire him out.

549
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,724
Make it quick, people. My son is busy.

550
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,810
He's got to go
to his news show, okay? Hurry.

551
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,023
I've got to hurry.

552
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,566
Got to go.

553
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,234
- Going out?
- Yes, to the airport.

554
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,611
Are you going on a trip?

555
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,238
I told you so many times.
I'm picking someone up.

556
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,323
Oh, right.

557
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,784
New blouse?

558
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,203
Yes, it is. Nice, isn't it?

559
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,704
It's nice.

560
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,666
I think he's going to propose.

561
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,044
What?

562
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,213
Oh, come on.

563
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,049
Save yourself the trouble of getting
disappointed and threatening him.

564
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,342
Just settle down.

565
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,428
We're going to Jeju Island.
The blue night of Jeju Island.

566
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:50,971
I can feel it.

567
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,307
If he acts lukewarm again--

568
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,975
You could propose to him.

569
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,438
That's why I got this.

570
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,025
I'm going to propose to him.

571
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:03,984
What?

572
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,363
Good luck.

573
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,656
- I'm off.
- Bye.

574
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,376
I heard something really funny today.

575
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,586
With your superpower?

576
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,755
- Yes.
- What is it?

577
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,177
No, really?

578
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,555
- No way. Your homeroom teacher?
- Yes.

579
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,597
Wow.

580
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,724
I'll tell you if I hear more.

581
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,811
Promise? You have to tell me.

582
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,566
You're the only one
who listens to me, you know.

583
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,152
My mom doesn't believe in my superpower.

584
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,736
I believe in it.

585
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,658
Oh, hey. Are you busy this Saturday?

586
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,910
Saturday? No, I'm not busy.

587
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,246
Can you do me a favor then?

588
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,424
See you later. Bye.

599
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,354
You should've put on a hat.
People are staring.

600
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,149
Are you making fun of me?
No one seems to recognize me.

601
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,612
Hey, I managed to keep the press away.
I thought it might overwhelm you.

602
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,990
You must've been bored
because you're spewing nonsense.

Come on,
it looks like you want some attention.

Welcome to <i>Mr. Song Is on the Move,</i>
<i>News from the Scene</i>. I'm Song Ki-baek.

637
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,442
Following up on last week, let's discuss
the price gouging at Bbaengdeok Market.

638
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:17,071
Opposition to the views of last week's
consumer representative has emerged.

639
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,240
Today, we have a representative
from the Market Merchant Association.

640
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,575
Hello.

641
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:28,040
Hi. I have been running a restaurant
called Bbaengdeok's here

642
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,960
at the Bbaengdeok Market
for the last 20 years.

643
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:38,092
Well… About the price gouging…

644
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,051
We…

645
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,097
I don't think I can do this.

646
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,933
You said you could do this.
What's with the stutter?

647
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,686
When we talked yesterday,

648
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,521
you made some really good points.

649
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,856
You can just talk like that.

650
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,276
Here's an idea.
How about we talk over some rice wine?

651
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,570
This is a news show. Is it okay?

652
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,280
We're not that kind of news show.

653
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,574
We've come all the way here
to hear your thoughts.

654
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,701
If you stop here,
you won't be able to sleep.

655
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,330
You said you'd do whatever it takes
to save the market.

656
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,959
That's right. You're right.

657
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,045
Mr. Seong, please get us some rice wine
and a couple of glasses.

658
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,463
Okay.

659
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,092
We made some acorn jelly in the morning.
Would you like some?

660
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,844
Oh, sure. That'd be awesome.

661
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,220
I'll go get it.

662
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,263
All right. Thanks.

663
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,890
Please have a glass
and loosen up a little.

664
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,642
Gee. This is hard.

665
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,354
Isn't being in front of cameras
nerve-racking?

666
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,113
SEONHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
TALENT SHOW

667
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,992
Gu-won said he hoped we could all be here.

668
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,285
I think it was last year.

669
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,787
He bawled because his mom had work
and no one came.

670
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,247
- He did?
- Yes.

671
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,876
He's always fine by himself at the salon,
so I thought he was a mini-adult.

672
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,420
He's a child.
There's no such thing as a mini-adult.

673
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,047
This is nice.
It feels like I'm raising a kid again.

674
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,632
- Ki-baek.
- Over here.

675
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,468
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

676
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,595
I didn't know you guys would be here.

677
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,679
Thank you.

678
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,600
Gu-won is going to be so happy.

679
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:13,020
I did his makeup. He looks incredible.

680
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,605
He does? Let's go inside.

681
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,981
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go.

682
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,149
Yeah, let's go.

683
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,073
{\an8}JUNG GU-WON
LET'S GO

684
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,950
{\an8}Look, it's Gu-won.

685
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:39,838
Hello. I'm Jung Gu-won
from grade three, class five.

686
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:52,643
Once upon a time, there lived a liar lion
in the faraway Lion Land.

687
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,468
Cheese.

688
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,142
<i>One day, a rabbit came to the lion.</i>

689
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,272
- Hello, Lion.
- Hello, Rabbit.

690
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,316
Lion, your mane looks amazing.

691
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,152
Would you like to enter
the Coolest Animal Contest?

692
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,113
What? No.

693
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,824
I've never left this town before.

694
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,868
Don't worry. I got you.

695
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,121
I'm sure you'll be great.

696
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,581
I can't do it.

697
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,459
- You can.
- No, I can't.

698
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,420
- Come with me.
- No.

699
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,171
- Come on.
- No!

700
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,549
- Come on, let's go!
- I said no!

701
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,009
Wait for me!

702
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,721
I really want you on the show.

703
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,806
People trust you. You're perfect.

704
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,850
We're headed in different directions.

705
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,603
How dare he lie to my face?

706
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,645
<i>Song Ki-baek.</i>

707
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,480
<i>There's something about him.</i>

708
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,734
- Get out of my sight!
- You'll fall!

709
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,029
The lion followed the rabbit
and entered the Coolest Animal Contest.

710
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,822
COOLEST ANIMAL CONTEST

711
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,158
- Good luck!
- Thanks!

712
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,659
It was the lion's turn.

713
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,079
Roar!

714
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,290
I'm the coolest lion!

715
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,250
At that moment…

716
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,716
My mane!

717
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,135
My goodness. Oh, dear.

718
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,346
Poor little guy.

719
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,556
The lion's mane was fake!

720
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,266
The lion tricked us.

721
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,352
The lion is a liar!

722
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,155
- Lion!
- Go away!

723
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,660
Lion.

724
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,329
I told you I didn't want to do this!

725
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,122
But what can I do right now?

726
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,458
I'm sick! That is what the doctor said!

727
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,502
<i>Mr. Song Ki-baek. Are you all right?</i>

728
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,463
Do you think I can host a news show?
I mean, in this state.

729
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,760
Lion, I'm sorry.

730
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,053
Don't follow me!

731
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,060
The rabbit felt terrible, blaming herself
for revealing the lion's secret.

732
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,316
A lion without a mane.

733
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,694
Everybody will make fun of me
and hate me now.

734
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:03,041
You can still be a cool lion
even without a mane.

735
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,671
Liar. I'm nothing without my mane!

736
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,777
<i>Then the rabbit came and said…</i>

737
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:36,032
<i>Protect your heart. You're the only one</i>
<i>here who can protect yourself.</i>

738
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,494
You said I was your switch. So use me.

739
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:43,373
<i>I'm sure there's something</i>
<i>you can do well without a mane.</i>

740
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,333
I'm right here by your side.

741
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,461
Let's do this together.

742
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,046
Do you think I can do it?

743
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,757
Absolutely.

744
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,640
<i>Listen. Let's give this a shot.</i>

745
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,232
Help! Help me!

746
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,359
Help me!

747
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,655
- Roar!
- The hyenas are trying to eat me!

748
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,032
You have to save your friend!

749
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,077
I have to hurry,
but my mane is too heavy, and I can't run.

750
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,038
Then take the mane off.

751
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,289
You can do this!

752
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,540
Okay.

753
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,087
Roar!

754
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,672
Roar!

755
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,216
- Run!
- Run!

756
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,519
Are you all right?

757
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,438
Thank you, Lion.

758
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,233
You're the coolest lion I've ever seen.

759
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

760
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,863
Your bravery and kind heart
are so much cooler than a nice mane.

761
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,907
Thank you so much.

762
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,954
You're awesome. Awesome!

763
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,430
Ouch, that stings.

764
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:27,811
The lion saw the rabbit's small feet
covered in wounds.

765
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,690
Rabbit, why didn't you tell me
you were hurting?

766
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,360
I don't like to make anyone worry.

767
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,446
I'm a rabbit, and I'm nice to everyone.

768
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,532
You can cry when you're hurting.

769
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,993
Sometimes, crying makes you forget
that you're hurting.

770
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,496
You gave me the courage
to take off my mane.

771
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,915
I want to give you courage too.

772
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,722
<i>On Woo-ju,</i>
<i>you look really pretty when you smile.</i>

773
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,641
But you look very pretty
even when you're not smiling.

774
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,771
So just do what you want.

775
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,317
Smile when you want to,
and cry when you feel like it.

776
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,862
I'll be right by your side,
just like today.

777
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,157
<i>The rabbit decided to be brave too.</i>

778
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,117
But I…

779
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,332
I'm not okay at all.

780
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:43,094
<i>I thought the only way for me to survive</i>
<i>was to deck myself out with lies</i>

781
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,097
<i>and hide my true feelings.</i>

782
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,226
<i>The more I hid, the lonelier I felt.</i>

783
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,978
Rabbit, try this on.

784
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:52,896
Okay.

785
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,524
How do I look?

786
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,443
You look so cute and super cool.

787
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,694
- Really?
- Yeah!

788
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,115
Oh, Lion. Look over there.

789
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,033
Why?

790
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,585
<i>Don't bottle it up and hide it.</i>

791
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,629
<i>Be brave and say it out loud.</i>

792
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,881
<i>Say you're exhausted and afraid.</i>

793
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:24,177
I'm now happy without a mane!

794
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,306
<i>Tell people you like them and love them.</i>

795
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,019
That lion resembles you, don't you think?

796
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,646
Yeah.

797
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,399
Are you crying?

798
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,860
Well, it's so touching.

799
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,257
So, did the lion throw away
his precious fake mane?

800
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,216
All right.

801
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,926
He should throw it away.

802
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:12,100
Actually, the lion hid his fake mane
in a safe place.

803
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,030
Because the lion might want to wear
a nice mane from time to time.

804
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,531
He certainly might.

805
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:38,001
But the lion no longer wears the mane
to hide his true self.

806
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,335
That's right.

807
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,256
Because the lion is not a liar anymore.

808
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,139
Lion, I want to go see
what's beyond the field over there.

809
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,684
Will you come with me?
I'd be too scared to go by myself.

810
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,729
The rabbit has also learned how to ask

811
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,607
for her friends' help
without hiding her feelings.

812
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,775
Should I go or not?

813
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,611
Well, all right. Let's go together.

814
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:09,324
The lion and the rabbit
remained good friends,

815
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,119
living happily together for many years.

816
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,039
- Yay! Let's go!
- Yay! Let's go!

817
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,963
YOU'RE THE BEST

818
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,050
{\an8}- Terrific!
- Great job!

819
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,513
Attention. Bow.

820
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,393
- Bye!
- Bye!

821
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,605
- Way to go, Gu-won!
- Great job!

822
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,232
Bravo!

823
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,025
LET'S GO, GU-WON

824
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,407
Awesome!

825
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,338
Here you are, Ki-baek.

826
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,257
Aren't you going to go?

827
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,095
It was just a children's play,
but it hit me pretty hard.

828
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,433
Do you want to go up to the stage?

829
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,687
Yeah?

830
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,574
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

831
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,581
You smile so beautifully these days.

832
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,000
- What?
- You look comfortable.

833
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,960
Different from when I first met you.

834
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,714
Oh, well… You look different too, Woo-ju.

835
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,716
Do I?

836
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,768
Mr. Lion, do you want to try on the mane?

837
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,978
No, forget it.

838
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,981
Are you serious?

839
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,524
Yeah. Here.

840
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,655
Let me see.

841
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,743
You look adorable.

842
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,477
MY UNIVERSE

843
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:49,400
The most important
and decisive moments of my life,

844
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,070
you were in every single one of them.

845
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,115
The universe is vast and eternal.

846
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,536
Please be my universe
for a long, long time.

847
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,836
Who engraved the outside of the ring?

848
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,505
What is this, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>?

849
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,382
You can't see it if it's on the inside.

850
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,050
I did the same with mine.

851
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,314
I used to pretend I was fine
no matter how I was actually feeling.

852
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,277
You're the first person
I could be honest with.

853
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,239
Thank you.

854
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,639
Is someone there?

855
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,932
What?

856
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,226
What's going on?

857
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,853
What are you doing? The show's over.

858
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,187
Oh, I'm sorry.

859
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,274
Wait, you look familiar.

860
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,653
Hi, I'm Song Ki-baek.

861
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:23,036
This is the woman I love very much,
and I just proposed to her.

862
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,457
Please turn off the lights
when you leave.

863
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,708
Okay.

864
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,671
He already turned all the lights off,
so what did he mean…

865
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,214
What?

866
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,225
Wow.

867
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,982
It's pretty.

868
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,697
Don't you think
you were being too honest?

869
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,284
Well, I love you.
How can I possibly hide it?

870
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,789
You're right.
When you're in love, you can't hide it.

871

Mr. Song Ki-baek!

873

{\an8}Why do you keep showing up?
Don't come up here!

{\an8}- Go away!
- Don't move!

875
