- What did you say?
- I mean, Yoon Bok.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.855
He's always been drawing lines with people since high school,

so we called him Seon* Yoon Bok, not Shin Yoon Bok.
(Means "line")

Yes, that's right.

I'm Yoon Bok's best friend.

Not me. It's Yoon Bok.

I was motivated when you told me I was a great teacher.

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:05.259
So, I tried being courageous today.

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:10.375
