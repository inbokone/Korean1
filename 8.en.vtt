00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.349
I knew from the beginning

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.603
That we would get along well

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:28.403
No, I...

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.231
Since when have you been here?

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.943
Me? For about an hour?

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.906
But what kind of dream did you have

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.241
That made you break out in a cold sweat?

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.160
No, it's okay

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.289
Jaemin, did something happen?

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:23.250
Your face is pale

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.711
What do you mean, work

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.838
Nothing happened

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.507
Have you eaten?

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.884
You haven't eaten until this time, have you?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.386
I'll make pasta for you

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.762
I already ate

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.181
Really?

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.182
Yes

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.644
I went grocery shopping to make you pasta

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.521
I guess I'll make it tomorrow

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.461
Jaemin, come here

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.802
Is it hard waiting for me?

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.346
I'll do better

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.392
So please wait a little longer, okay?

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.895
Once I'm done with my busy schedule

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.773
I'll really support you properly

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.152
Okay, thank you

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:05.352
[Lee Taeha: Did you get home safely yesterday? I'm sorry about yesterday. I think I was in a hurry, I apologize.]

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.035
What? You're already up?

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:24.913
Jaemin

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.709
Yes?

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.420
What's this?

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.631
What?

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.726
Who is it? Were you with them yesterday?

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.355
Just someone I do study sessions with

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.482
Just someone you do study sessions with

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.859
Sends a text like this?

00:03:58.613 --> 00:03:59.948
Something happened, right?

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.243
Tell me now

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.540
We just had a meal

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.167
We just had a meal!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.794
Why are you hiding it?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.925
What happened?

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.054
Are you, by any chance,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.560
shaken by someone else?

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.563
No, it's not like that

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.524
Be honest

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.027
Yesterday...

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.989
What happened with that person?

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.286
We just had a meal and came home

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.829
And that person kissed me

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.545
I was really surprised too

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.756
I really didn't expect it

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.925
And I told them I have a lover

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.724
You kissed someone else and came back

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.519
And lied to me?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.192
I did that because I thought you might misunderstand

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.526
We're really nothing

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.653
I was worried you might misunderstand

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.197
It seems like you're the one creating the misunderstanding now?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.866
Nami...

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.870
I really didn't know you

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:31.915
That you could be so brazen

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.959
And lie like this...

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.337
I really didn't know

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.508
Jaemin

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.097
That

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.641
You were shaken

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:16.334
I was surprised you contacted me first

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.047
I actually had another study session today

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.007
But I skipped it and came

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.719
Um...

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.267
I'll say it again, I have a lover

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.602
Ah...

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.229
I know

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.150
It would be strange if someone like you didn't have a lover

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.901
I thought that from the beginning

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.114
Ah

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.785
Then why did you do it?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.290
Ah

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.877
I'm sorry

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.837
I will apologize

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.589
I was in a hurry

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.134
No, you don't have to apologize

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.057
Please don't contact me anymore

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.021
I came out to say that today

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:21.941
Ah

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.861
I see

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.408
Jaemin

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.247
Honestly, you were shaken, right?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.297
I can tell by looking into your eyes

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.009
Actually, I knew from the first time I saw you

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:53.181
Ah, this person is lonely

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.560
You're similar to me

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.569
That's why I was drawn to you

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.406
Not just me, but you too, Jaemin

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.369
I can wait

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.667
I told you it doesn't matter if you have a lover

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.919
Honestly

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.924
It's true that I was a bit shaken

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.386
So I was disappointed in myself

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.056
I hurt the person I love

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.857
I don't want to hurt that person anymore

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.528
And I don't want to give false hope to someone I don't have feelings for

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.948
I was mistaken

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.826
I thought I could hide the fact that I was a little shaken

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.619
But I couldn't

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.374
Can we at least be friends?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.759
No

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.680
I don't want to

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.475
I don't want to

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.606
Because I don't want to hurt that person anymore

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.070
You're firm

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.703
I'm sorry for shaking you

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:45.293
I'm jealous of Jaemin's lover

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.216
They must be a good person, right?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.055
Yes

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.434
They are more than I deserve

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.197
I should go now

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.290
[It's me, I'm in front of your house Please, let's talk face to face]

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.997
Why are you doing this?

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.083
Do you know what time it is?

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.256
I'm sorry

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.552
I'm sorry for lying

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.848
Jaemin

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:09.520
I'm not just disappointed that you lied

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.193
It's that you didn't trust me

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:17.487
What?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.324
Whatever happened to you

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.203
If you had told me the truth

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:28.247
I would never have misunderstood you

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:29.832
But

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.339
You lied because you didn't trust me

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:39.967
Yes

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.222
Was I...

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.517
Not trustworthy?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.397
No, I was afraid of hurting you

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.359
Hurt...

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.196
I did get hurt, a lot

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.826
If I had heard it directly from you

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.955
It would have hurt less

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.961
I was wrong

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.090
I won't do it again

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.391
I thought you'd never want to see me again

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.271
How could I not see you?

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.066
I miss you to death even if I don't see you for a day

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:47.326
Whatever happens, tell me everything

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.665
I'll listen to it all, okay?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:54.751
Okay

00:13:56.878 --> 00:14:00.089
I have a lot of questions but I'll hold back

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.091
Hmm?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.971
I don't know, there's just something

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.604
How can I live without seeing this face?

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.148
I have something to say

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.233
Hmm?

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.529
I love you

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.830
I love you too

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.011
Me too

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.972
I love you
