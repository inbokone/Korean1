1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,244
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,333
License plate, 5428.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,919
Pull over to the side of the road, 5428.

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,050
-Hey, Hyunkyung.
-Lieutenant, where are you?

7
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,260
We're close to getting him.

8
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,179
-It's dangerous. Get out of there.
-What?

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,473
Someone cut the ratchet buckle
of the trailer.

10
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
That trailer is the next target.

11
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,975
What?

12
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,359
What? What's going on?

13
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,789
Stop the car, 5428.

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,129
Stop, 5428. Pull over.

15
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,589
It isn't working!

16
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,107
Damn it!

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,569
Don't let him
pass here. Stop him at all costs!

18
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,104
Han Kyungsoo.

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,148
-Hold on.
-Are you okay?

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,441
Be careful.

21
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,729
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER
HITS NEWLYWEDS

22
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,272
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

23
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,159
CRASH

24
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,493
YEONHEE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,953
Did you check the trailer?

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,247
Yes, the MO was the same.
The ratchet buckle.

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,333
The dashcam was formatted and turned off.

28
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,709
The trailer was overloaded and modified.

29
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,711
And the driver?

30
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,463
He's in the ward. Let's go see him.

31
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,136
Hello.

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,264
Mr. Han Kyungsoo, how are you feeling?

33
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,601
I'm okay. Thank you for helping me.

34
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,730
-It's okay. You can lie down.
-No, I'm fine.

35
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,109
What did you do upon arriving
at the rest area yesterday?

36
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,905
Well, around 7:30 p.m. yesterday,

37
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,909
I went to the lounge to wash up
and do my laundry.

38
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,578
I left around 10 p.m.

39
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,124
It appears someone has cut
the ratchet buckle on purpose.

40
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,251
What? Who?

41
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,338
We're still investigating.
Is there anyone you suspect?

42
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,465
Someone who'd do such a thing to you.

43
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,179
No, there's no one.

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,974
I see.

45
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,851
Okay. Please get better soon.

46
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,270
-Okay.
-All right.

47
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,078
Was it you?

48
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,207
Wasn't it your doing?

49
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,629
It's strange that I suddenly ran into you.

50
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,923
Who else would do such a thing?

51
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,384
Why would I?

52
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,263
Why would I do that to you?

53
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,223
Well…

54
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
Did you receive a letter by any chance?

55
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,689
-No.
-I didn't specify which letter.

56
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,815
I mean--

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,284
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER
HITS NEWLYWEDS

58
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,080
Why did you lie?

59
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,999
What on earth are you hiding?

60
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,627
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,504
I have nothing to hide.

62
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm not the only one who got it.

63
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,433
Did someone else receive this letter?

64
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,901
Everyone.

65
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,528
Jaeyoung, Jungwook,

66
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,447
and even Jungwook's father.

67
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,790
-Here we go.
-All right.

68
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,584
Lieutenant Min,
you could've gotten hurt.

69
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,544
She doesn't get hurt.
She's Superwoman.

70
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,629
I am?

71
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,548
By the way.

72
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,345
The man who was with Detective Woo
in front of the lounge yesterday.

73
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,848
Who was he?
He was wearing a green hat too.

74
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,809
In front of the lounge yesterday?

75
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh, Seo Dongwoo.
He was the driver who gave us a tip.

76
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,982
But it wasn't a green hat. It was blue.

77
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,527
I see.

78
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,781
The green hat Cho Ikhwan saw.

79
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,576
There's a chance it wasn't green.

80
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,620
-What?
-What do you mean?

81
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,375
Please stand here for a second.

82
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,459
What?

83
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,421
-Here?
-Where?

84
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,715
What is Inspector Cha doing?

85
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,801
Let's see.

86
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,511
Can you see me well?

87
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,846
Yes.

88
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,689
-What do you think?
-It looks good on you.

89
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,149
It doesn't look good on you.

90
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,068
I didn't mean it like that.
What's the color of this hat?

91
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,531
Green.

92
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,575
Come here for a second.

93
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,002
What? It was definitely green.

94
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,421
Depending on the light
it absorbs and reflects,

95
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,173
the color could look different.

96
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,926
That means the culprit
might have been wearing a blue hat.

97
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,680
I mean that it'll be hard
to identify the culprit with a hat.

98
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,140
You're right.

99
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,018
All right.
We just need to find someone

100
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
who's after Nam Jaehoon and Han Kyungsoo.

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,691
Remember what the driver said
at the rest area?

102
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,238
A few months ago, a friend of mine
caused a car carrier trailer accident.

103
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
He said the accident occurred

104
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,702
even though he had fastened the belt
and secured the parking brake.

105
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,454
He felt so victimized.

106
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,748
When he tried to check,

107
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,125
the dashcam was turned off.

108
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,212
What if there's another victim

109
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,297
other than Nam Jaehoon and Han Kyungsoo?

110
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,856
FEBRUARY 25TH, 4 P.M. SUNDAY
VEHICLE ROLL OVER

111
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,859
Captain, you're here.

112
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,695
Did everyone pull an all-nighter?

113
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,739
Yes. We had to check something in a hurry.

114
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,328
Where are you going?

115
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,040
Get some sleep. I'll go buy some coffee.

116
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,459
Captain is the best.

117
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
Okay.

118
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,754
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

119
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,006
Enter.

120
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,933
Here is the list of visitors
you requested, sir.

121
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,813
Thank you.

122
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,740
VISITOR LOG

123
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,792
LEE JUNGSUB

124
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,924
Lee Jungsub.

125
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,429
Aside from Nam Jaehoon
and Han Kyungsoo,

126
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,097
there were two more victims.

127
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,473
So Inbum and Nam Kwangryul

128
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,184
got into the same accident
in February and May respectively.

129
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,606
To find the connection, we checked
the vehicle registration certificates.

130
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,232
You see the part I checked, right?

131
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,902
If a commercial license plate is borrowed,
the owner on the certificate

132
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,280
becomes the shipping company,
not the freight driver.

133
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:19,201
Although there was a difference in time,
both vehicles were under CY Logistics.

134
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,871
The overlapping period
was about a year and three months

135
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,332
from February 2021 to May 2022.

136
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,667
The owner on the documents
is Kang Changseok, age 52.

137
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,294
He was the CEO of CY Logistics.

138
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,921
The company name changed
and he's now the CEO of Svaha Logistics.

139
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,341
Did something happen at the company?

140
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,676
He keeps closing a business
and opening a new one.

141
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,722
It seems like a typical sourcing scam.

142
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,600
With the promise of profits,
they recruit freight drivers

143
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,268
and sell commercial license plates.

144
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,771
Then they harass the freight drivers
for various reasons

145
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,356
and get the license plates back.

146
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,651
I'm sure there are a lot of victims.

147
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,070
If that's the case,

148
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,698
why didn't the culprit
go after Kang Changseok?

149
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,200
He has a point.

150
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,494
Let's meet up with the victims first.

151
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,122
Let's find out what happened there.

152
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
SO INBUM, NAM KWANGRYUL

153
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,878
I'm a busy man.
Why are you asking me about that?

154
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,630
It's a done deal.

155
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,757
We think someone might've caused
the accident,

156
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,217
so we're reinvestigating.

157
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,177
Did you make any enemies in the past or--

158
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,389
I'm busy making a living.
I have no time to make enemies.

159
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,143
Your time at the company
overlapped with these men.

160
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,520
Do you know them?

161
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,531
Of course not.

162
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,199
I don't know everyone in the company.

163
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,911
After getting the license plate,
the freight drivers work separately.

164
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,371
What about these men?

165
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,581
They had the same accident as you.

166
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,584
We think it's connected
to the sourcing company.

167
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,383
I think I've seen their faces a few times,

168
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,301
but nothing out of the ordinary.

169
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,851
Please excuse me.

170
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,564
Yes, Lieutenant.

171
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,315
Hyunkyung, did you get anything?

172
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,652
It feels like he's hiding something,
but he isn't talking.

173
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,238
It's the same here.

174
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,366
Why would they hide something
after such an accident?

175
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,705
I hope Han Kyungsoo tells us something.

176
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,297
I don't know who these people are.

177
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,715
I don't want to know either.

178
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,095
They're the freight drivers
who had a similar accident to you.

179
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,765
All four of them were

180
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,433
under CY Logistics in the past.

181
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,814
So the cause of the accident was--

182
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,443
As of now, it looks like
it's connected to CY Logistics.

183
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,741
That means it wasn't connected
to the letter.

184
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,326
Do you think

185
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,537
the accident and the letter are connected?

186
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,126
Mr. Han Kyungsoo.

187
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,463
You witnessed the accident I caused.

188
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,091
Is there something I don't know?

189
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,557
What's the truth I don't know?

190
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,147
I can only help you
if you tell me the truth.

191
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,115
I don't know. There's nothing like that.

192
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,784
You should go.

193
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,589
What did he say?

194
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,924
He said he didn't know them.

195
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,928
Do you really think
he really doesn't know them?

196
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,137
No.

197
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,515
What's up with these people?

198
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,476
Mr. Nam Jaehoon
is the only remaining one.

199
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,938
You know that I'm waiting, right?

200
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,817
I'm waiting for you to tell me

201
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,320
about the relationship
between you and Han Kyungsoo.

202
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,046
Did these men really go through
the same thing as I did?

203
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
Do you know them?

204
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,386
-I wouldn't say that, but--
-Mr. Nam, please tell us the truth.

205
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,805
You know why the culprit
went after them, don't you?

206
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,813
There's something that comes to mind.

207
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,609
You ran CY Logistics
in the past, right?

208
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,985
Yes. What is this about?

209
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,695
Do you know these men?

210
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,490
They worked at CY Logistics
around the same time.

211
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,911
I know them. What about them?

212
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,622
They all got in
a similar accident recently.

213
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,750
Did something happen
when they were working at your company?

214
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,876
Nonsense.

215
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,922
They were affiliated with my company,
but they worked individually.

216
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,466
So I don't know if they're close or not.

217
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,802
Were there any issues with the schedules
or commercial license plate fee?

218
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,221
Of course not. Did someone say there was?

219
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,644
There were minor problems
that came with running a business.

220
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,022
But think about it.
No one forced them to be a freight driver.

221
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,025
If they didn't like the fee,
they don't have to buy it.

222
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,111
As for the schedule,
it was done in a rational manner.

223
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,738
There were no big conflicts.

224
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,991
-You didn't have issues with them, right?
-Of course not.

225
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,619
It's a bit embarrassing
to say this myself,

226
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,456
but I look out for the freight drivers.

227
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,583
When we work together, we're a family.

228
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,253
I try hard to appease them
even though I'm the CEO. Seriously.

229
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,839
These days, the freight drivers have
the upper hand

230
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,132
and I have the lower hand.

231
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,514
It's true.

232
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,433
-If that's all…
-Okay.

233
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,851
-We'll get going.
-Okay.

234
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,854
Bye.

235
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,731
Come on.

236
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,275
-What?
-Yeonji, you must be bored.

237
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,777
Changseok.

238
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,612
-That hat--
-Give up.

239
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,489
We don't know if it's blue or green.

240
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,950
It isn't that.
It belongs to someone I know.

241
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,618
What?

242
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,789
So what is this about?

243
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,708
This consent form makes no sense.

244
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,377
-Why?
-"It's my will to carry five cars.

245
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,714
Any problems or accidents
that occur as a result

246
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,132
is the driver's responsibility."

247
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,634
What kind of a consent form is this?

248
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,263
You'll make me overload
and feign ignorance if an accident occurs.

249
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,973
I see you understood it correctly.

250
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm not forcing you.
The decision is up to you, Mr. Seo.

251
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,687
-That little…
-Not yet.

252
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,357
You said you wouldn't
give me work if I didn't sign it.

253
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,942
I did? When?

254
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,278
Then what was he saying to me just now?

255
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,696
"Sign it or quit."

256
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,115
-You punk. Did you really say that?
-I'm sorry.

257
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,201
How could you give him only two options
in this day and age?

258
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,162
You want to get in trouble?

259
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,539
-Look back upon yourself.
-Yes, sir.

260
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,875
Mr. Seo, please be understanding.

261
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm sure he was just looking out for you.

262
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,049
How will you make big money
if you're so inflexible?

263
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,843
You need money to get married
and be good to your parents.

264
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,596
Didn't you say your parents passed away?

265
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:40,601
That's why you need to be good to them
when they're still alive.

266
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,147
It's not too late to show them
that you're living well.

267
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,858
I'm not doing this for my own gain.

268
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,902
This is a win-win situation, okay?

269
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,450
Like I said, the decision is up to you.

270
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,919
Detective.

271
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,504
We meet again.

272
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,762
This consent form is nonsense.
It's illegal.

273
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,639
I'm well aware.

274
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,600
But what can I do? I have no choice.

275
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,644
Why didn't you report it?
It's not too late.

276
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,395
It's no use.

277
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,607
There was no violence
or evidence of a threat.

278
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,359
Fighting alone won't change a thing.

279
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
But you should still try.

280
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,988
Are you going to sign it?

281
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,457
Back then,
everyone signed the consent form.

282
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,210
In case of an accident,

283
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,004
the consent form would serve as evidence

284
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,133
that the freight drivers overloaded
by their own volition

285
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,717
despite the company's dissuasion.

286
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,056
We had no choice
since we had to make a living.

287
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,268
One day, an accident occurred.

288
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,686
And just as we suspected,

289
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,772
they made the freight driver
take full responsibility.

290
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,857
Sir.

291
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,277
You need to pay for the loss
from damaging the cars.

292
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,364
There's nothing the company can do.

293
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,826
You signed the form, remember? Hey.

294
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,288
Yeonji, make it sweet.

295
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,290
-Two, two, three?
-Sounds good.

296
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,541
Look.

297
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,670
Lee Wonmin, Kim Sanil, Seo Youngchul.

298
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,963
You signed it here.

299
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,132
You threatened to not give me any work.

300
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,091
I asked around.

301
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,010
This is an unfair contract.

302
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,970
Damn it, I died.

303
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,264
I don't understand.

304
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,893
Why are you complaining
when you signed the consent form?

305
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,854
"Unfair contract"?
Are you going to sue me?

306
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,815
Sir, let me give you a piece of advice.

307
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,319
Don't try any funny business
and find a way to live.

308
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,198
If you have no money,

309
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,034
keep your face down and make ends meet.
Why act out?

310
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,785
-Hey, get rid of him.
-Yes, sir.

311
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,206
Sir, you can't do this!

312
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,583
-You can't!
-Get out of here.

313
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,710
-Go.
-Sir.

314
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,796
-What are you looking at? Go work.
-This is an unfair contract.

315
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,715
Hey! An unfair contract?

316
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,593
What's fair is taking responsibility
for what you signed.

317
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,762
Everyone, let's work with a smile.

318
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,223
I said, go work.

319
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,099
It was a wake-up call.

320
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,561
I realized that it may happen
to me someday.

321
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,650
So we visited a lawyer together

322
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,194
and sued the CEO for fraud.

323
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,904
Please take good care of us.

324
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,782
These men were in it with me.

325
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,659
So what happened?

326
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,207
The CEO filed a counterclaim
for obstruction of business.

327
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,667
He even hired a big law firm.

328
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,672
When things became complicated,
we couldn't do anything.

329
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,093
The CEO continued to blackmail
and harass us,

330
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,429
so everyone dropped the charges.

331
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,224
Except one person.

332
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,562
The car carrier trailer driver
who caused the accident.

333
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,677
NAM KWANGRYUL

334
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,306
The number
you have dialed--

335
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,057
INBUM

336
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,769
The number
you have dialed--

337
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,242
DEFENDANT KANG CHANGSEOK
VERDICT ACQUITTAL

338
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:09,012
SEIZURE RELATED PAYMENT
SEO YOUNGCHUL

339
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,109
It was suicide.

340
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,945
Seo Youngchul.

341
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,115
I never forgot that name.

342
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,575
It felt like I had killed him.

343
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,954
Thank you for sharing it with us.

344
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,666
Did the driver have a son?

345
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,918
I don't know about that.

346
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,422
Were there only four drivers

347
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,340
who sued the CEO?

348
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,175
There was one more person.

349
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,677
Okay. What's his name?

350
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,304
His name

351
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,475
is Woo Gilsoon. Yes. Woo Gilsoon.

352
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,729
I remember because he had a woman's name
despite his big build.

353
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,982
Did you just say Woo Gilsoon?

354
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,536
Father, please pick up the phone. Darn it!

355
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,504
Seo Dongwoo.
He's the son of the late Seo Youngchul.

356
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,633
He is taking revenge on those
who contributed to his father's death.

357
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,802
Only one man remains.

358
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,847
-Did you track the location?
-Yes, just now. Let me check.

359
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,977
-What?
-What is it?

360
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,480
Seo Dongwoo and Detective Woo's father--

361
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,356
The two are in the same location.

362
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,649
What?

363
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,527
-Where is that?
-Lake Park.

364
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,841
Hey, Donggi. Hurry.

365
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,430
Donggi, have you reached your father?

366
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,307
-No.
-Let's look for him.

367
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,558
Okay.

368
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,062
Father! Goodness.

369
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,274
Oh, Donggi.

370
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,360
What are you doing here?

371
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,403
Why didn't you pick up? I was worried!

372
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,072
Gosh, you startled me.

373
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm not deaf, you punk!

374
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,663
I didn't swim across the Pacific Ocean
or hike down Mount Paektu.

375
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:44,125
Why are you shouting and making a fuss
when I just came out for a walk?

376
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,835
You were with Seo Dongwoo, right?

377
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,549
-How do you know that?
-Sir, I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee.

378
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,969
Seo Dongwoo is on the wanted list.

379
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,845
What?

380
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,014
-Dongwoo is?
-Yes.

381
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,351
What did Seo Dongwoo say to you?

382
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,324
Have you been well, sir?

383
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,702
Of course.

384
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,454
I've been well.

385
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,164
Have you been well?

386
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,881
Here.

387
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,134
What is it?

388
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,219
SUJEONG-SI, GYEONGGI-DO
HANBYEOL MEMORIAL PARK

389
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,804
It's where my father rests.

390
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,726
If something happens to me,

391
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,646
please visit him once in a while.

392
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,817
What are you talking about?

393
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,070
Is something wrong?

394
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,453
Did you know?

395
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,416
You were the only one
who apologized to my father…

396
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,422
back then.

397
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,770
How will you make big money
if you're so inflexible?

398
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,439
You need money to get married
and be good to your parents.

399
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,733
Didn't you say your parents passed away?

400
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,446
That's why you need to be good to them
when they're still alive.

401
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,698
It's not too late to show them
that you're living well.

402
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm not doing this for my own gain.

403
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,661
It's a win-win situation, okay?

404
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,759
We checked the location
of Seo Dongwoo's trailer.

405
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,928
It's headed to Yunseo-gu, Munseon-si.

406
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,680
It's close
to Kang Changseok's company.

407
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,640
Request for backup right away.

408
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,183
I'm on my way.

409
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,897
Is Kang Changseok not picking up?

410
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,948
SVAHA LOGISTICS

411
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,908
All right.

412
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,337
What?

413
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,155
Come on out.

414
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,325
You!

415
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,894
-Let go of me.
-Seo Dongwoo,

416
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,229
you're under arrest for aggravated assault
and destruction of property.

417
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,064
I'll kill him. Let go of me!

418
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,613
Let go of me. I'll kill him.

419
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,119
I said, let go of me!

420
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,038
Let go of me.

421
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,791
Let go of me.

422
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,418
I'll kill that bastard!

423
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,922
I'll kill that bastard!

424
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,173
Let go of me!

425
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,012
Let go! Let go of me!

426
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,938
Mr. Seo Dongwoo.

427
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,065
Do you admit to damaging

428
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,818
the ratchet buckles and causing
four trailer accidents?

429
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,905
Yes.

430
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,741
Do you admit to the attempted murder
of Mr. Kang Changseok?

431
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,289
Yes.

432
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,501
Is that why you joined the company?

433
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,089
It…

434
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,968
wasn't my intention.

435
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,680
At first…

436
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,183
I just wanted to find evidence.

437
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,561
What kind of a consent form is this?

438
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,856
You'll make me overload
and feign ignorance if an accident occurs.

439
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,691
I see you understood it correctly.

440
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,403
I'm not forcing you.
The decision is up to you, Mr. Seo.

441
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,532
You said you wouldn't give me work
if I didn't sign it.

442
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,075
I did? When?

443
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,786
I went to a lawyer with the recording.

444
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you know what he said?

445
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,417
He'd probably get probation at worst.

446
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,507
My father…

447
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,179
didn't need the law
to lead an upright life.

448
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,184
But no one protected him.

449
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,353
Not the law.

450
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,565
Not even you, the police.

451
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,070
That was why I got payback

452
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,574
on those who caused my father's death.

453
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,749
We met when we were kids, right?

454
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,837
When I was little,
my father's trailer was the best.

455
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,924
I bragged to my friends
about how my dad had the biggest car.

456
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,552
I begged my father
and rode with him a few times.

457
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,263
There was a kid just like me.

458
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,479
Now that I've grown up,
it's a fond memory.

459
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,272
Since it's a memory of my father.

460
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,234
I'm sure it's the same for you.

461
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,960
Did you sleep well? Is our baby okay?

462
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,713
I can't wait to see our baby.

463
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,590
I'll go home right after work.

464
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,759
Is there anything you want to eat?

465
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:53,137
No, just come home
quickly. Our baby wants to see his daddy.

466
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,889
Okay.

467
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,308
Do you want something like tasty apples--

468
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,645
Honey. Hello?

469
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,064
The ratchet buckle
from Nam Jaehoon's trailer

470
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,148
killed this victim.

471
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,948
Do you get it now?

472
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,577
Do you see what you've done?

473
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,406
Donggi.

474
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,160
What will happen to Dongwoo now?

475
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,163
He'll receive a punishment.

476
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,206
How severe?

477
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,293
How do I know? I'm not a judge.

478
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,632
Why didn't you tell me

479
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,635
about what happened at CY Logistics?

480
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,180
You prepared for a lawsuit.

481
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,642
Father, I'm your son.

482
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,854
Why must I hear about your matters
from others?

483
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,523
You punk, how was I supposed to tell you?

484
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,318
I was scared.

485
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,780
Huh? Because I deserted my friend.

486
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,923
Gilsoon.

487
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,636
Hey, Youngchul.

488
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm sorry.

489
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,145
I…

490
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,690
I can't go on any longer.

491
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,825
I'm sorry.

492
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,085
What was the use

493
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:35,299
of driving the trailer
for 12 to 15 hours a day?

494
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,303
The company took all the money we made.

495
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,181
We had to fight to survive.

496
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,016
But

497
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,770
we couldn't say anything

498
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,481
because we were afraid of getting fired.

499
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,281
Do you know what scared me the most?

500
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,285
I was scared

501
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,290
my son and my family
might find out I am a coward

502
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,501
who trembles in fear.

503
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,212
That's what scared me the most.

504
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,425
Father.

505
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,845
I'm competent now.

506
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,556
I gain recognition at work.

507
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,019
If things get tough,

508
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,149
you can lean on me a little.

509
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,368
Thank you.

510
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:04,013
Fixing the damage will cost more
than buying a used trailer.

511
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,348
You should scrap it.

512
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,019
How will I make a living if I scrap it?
I'm still paying monthly installments.

513
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,356
Please help me so I can ride it
until I pay it off.

514
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,524
No, you're asking the impossible.

515
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,277
I'll get criticized for it. Take it back.

516
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,821
Sir, don't be like that.
Please help me out.

517
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,157
Take it. I'm busy, okay? Bye.

518
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,409
Sir. Sir!

519
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,469
Shall I prepare some tea?

520
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,896
Do I need to call you first
to receive a report?

521
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,359
Not much progress has been made,
so I had planned to make a report later.

522
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,365
Is the investigation difficult

523
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,785
or are personal feelings clouding
your judgments?

524
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,122
Do you still meet Lee Jungsub?

525
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,797
Your expression tells me
that you're doubtful.

526
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,468
I put you in charge of this case
because I thought you were capable

527
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,138
of keeping your personal
and professional life separate--

528
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,814
I thought you had many things to cut.
Did the knife turn dull already?

529
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,860
Gosh, seriously.

530
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,364
Please bring me results next time.

531
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,868
As I grow older, I lose patience.

532
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,419
You can go now.

533
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,898
Drunk driving is still getting
more widespread, despite the crackdown.

534
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,192
Alcohol is to blame.

535
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,029
Where did Captain go?

536
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,699
-Commissioner General called him over.
-He seems to be calling him a lot.

537
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,286
Maybe Captain will go back
to the headquarters.

538
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,455
-No way.
-Why not?

539
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,956
It's the transfer season.

540
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,667
Our team has solved many cases.

541
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,795
To top it off, they were big cases too.

542
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,839
TCI has been undervalued
despite our achievements.

543
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,758
While that's true--

544
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,718
Geez. No way.

545
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,972
Captain.

546
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,599
Why did he ask to see you?

547
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,560
-If you're going to the headquarters--
-For goodness' sake.

548
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,198
-I received an order to take on a case.
-An order?

549
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,910
What case? Hold on. Let me see it.

550
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,123
What's this?

551
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,835
IDENTITY VERIFICATION REPORT

552
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,211
What? This man--

553
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,130
-He looks familiar.
-Yang Jaeyoung?

554
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,091
What? I know who he is.

555
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,261
A female employee jumped out of a car
because of him.

556
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,805
Ms. Kim Minju. That shameless criminal.

557
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,974
Oh, you're right. What a rotten man.

558
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,102
-Did he die in a car accident?
-It wasn't an accident.

559
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,895
It was a murder.

560
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,022
What? A murder?

561
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,315
A murder?

562
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,776
My goodness.

563
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,951
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT ON ROUTE ONE

564
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,917
YANG JAEYOUNG'S CAR
BEFORE AND AFTER THE ACCIDENT

565
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,591
DIRECTOR PYO JUNGWOOK

566
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,885
The man inside is my friend.
I came to see my friend.

567
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,052
For goodness' sake.

568
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,054
I'm telling you, we made plans.

569
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,098
Go ask him.

570
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,267
Director, someone is here to see you.

571
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,144
-For goodness' sake.
-Come on.

572
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,146
-Let go of me.
-My goodness.

573
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,482
That punk.

574
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:32,072
Hey, Jungwook. My friend.

575
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,992
Your office is really nice.

576
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,327
You have bodyguards too.

577
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,164
Ms. Hyerim,
bring him a cup of tea.

578
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,790
It's okay. You can go now.

579
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,667
Yes, sir.

580
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,887
Kyungsoo, you grew some balls.
You contacted me first.

581
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,057
Why?

582
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,685
Your father told me to call
if I was struggling.

583
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,484
I'll cut straight to the chase.

584
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,237
I need money.

585
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:17,284
Sure. It's been a while
since I gave you an allowance.

586
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,996
How much do you need?
I don't carry a lot of cash these days.

587
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,373
Just give me 300 million won.

588
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,378
You're crazy.

589
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,556
Gosh.

590
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,392
You shouldn't have.

591
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,645
By the way, I recently met

592
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,897
Cha Yeonho.

593
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:52,903
But he already knew
that we had received the letters.

594
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,283
How does he know that?

595
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,453
Did you say "we"?
Did you receive the letter too?

596
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,418
Look at this punk.

597
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,213
-And you lied to me about it.
-Hey.

598
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,928
What do you think will happen
if I tell the police everything?

599
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,100
If I reveal the truth
about what happened ten years ago?

600
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,023
I wonder what'll happen.

601
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,527
I'm sure nothing will happen to you,
you foolish bastard.

602
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,654
Who'll believe a punk like you?

603
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,323
Only you'll die.

604
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,075
It's either I get killed like Jaeyoung
or die hungry.

605
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,201
Nothing can stop me now.

606
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,752
Han Fatty, how did you change so much?

607
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,504
Where did you get those guts?

608
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,091
They say beggars lose
their instinct for self-preservation.

609
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,635
I guess this is what they mean.

610
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,139
It's 300 million won.

611
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,808
I won't wait long.

612
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,436
Thanks.

613
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,064
You even gave me money for gas.

614
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,567
Oh, right.

615
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,613
Hey.

616
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,909
I saw that black car too.

617
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,244
So

618
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,956
you should be careful, okay?

619
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,668
Director Pyo Jungwook.

620
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,428
Damn, that bastard.

621
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,348
Shall I kill him?

622
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,447
What are you doing?
Everyone is waiting for a meeting.

623
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,119
I have a question.

624
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:12,167
Why did Commissioner General Pyo order you
to take on Yang Jaeyoung's case?

625
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,965
Why do you want to know?

626
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,300
Yang Jaeyoung

627
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,178
was a witness of my accident.

628
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,639
One of the three high school students.

629
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,350
-The others are--
-Pyo Jungwook.

630
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,645
He's Commissioner General Pyo's son.
The other one is Han Kyungsoo.

631
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,067
I received a letter.
It's a type of blackmail.

632
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,280
I thought only I had received it,
but I wasn't the only one.

633
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,657
Me, Yang Jaeyoung, Han Kyungsoo,

634
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,409
Pyo Jungwook, Pyo Myunghak

635
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,161
and even Mr. Lee Jungsub.

636
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,873
-Who told you that?
-Han Kyungsoo.

637
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,417
I met with Mr. Lee not too long ago.

638
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,630
Seeing as how he gave you
Yang Jaeyoung's case,

639
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,091
perhaps Commissioner General Pyo--

640
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,968
Do you think Yang Jaeyoung's death

641
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,804
is related to your past accident?

642
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,852
The black car that was filmed
at Yang Jaeyoung's accident,

643
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,731
I think I saw a similar car
at Sangsan Rest Area

644
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,483
just before Han Kyungsoo's accident.

645
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,360
Are you certain?

646
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,407
No, I'm not certain.
I didn't get a look at the license plate.

647
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,162
But the car model and tinted windows
were the same.

648
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,874
What if the culprit
who killed Yang Jaeyoung

649
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,375
is after Han Kyungsoo as well?

650
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,632
I understand what you're saying.

651
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,383
I'll look into the black car.

652
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,102
Are you saying
that Han Kyungsoo asked for money?

653
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,647
Will you give it to him?

654
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,691
Borrowing money will become a habit.

655
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,819
Leave it to me.

656
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,445
He'll be docile

657
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,950
if I call him over
and educate him for a few days.

658
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,204
Or you could use this opportunity
to cut him off.

659
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,006
Hey. Sit down.

660
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,307
It's material on the case
regarding Chairman Yang's son.

661
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,392
What?

662
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,562
I told him to look into it.

663
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,231
We're a family from now on,
so talk freely among yourselves

664
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,816
without hiding anything.

665
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,193
Let's have a drink. Come on.

666
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,160
Let's see it.

667
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,462
This is footage of the lobby
of Chairman Yang's construction company.

668
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,971
The man who's following Pyo Jungwook

669
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,099
is Lee Jungsub.

670
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,848
What are you so hesitant to talk about?

671
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,809
It shows on your face.

672
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,022
What do you want to talk about?

673
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,360
You know Yang Jaeyoung, right?

674
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,487
He was one of the witnesses
of Hyunsoo's accident.

675
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,408
He was killed.

676
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,747
Jungsub, did you know?

677
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,502
Jungsub.

678
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,922
Who? Why?

679
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,175
Aren't those the important questions?

680
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,428
Who did it? Why did he or she do it?

681
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,224
As you may know,

682
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,270
there are people who deserve to die.

683
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,068
Isn't that what you wished for too?

684
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,870
DETECTIVE IN CHARGE
OF THE DAEJEON NEWLYWED ACCIDENT

685
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,544
LATE-NIGHT DRIVER HITS NEWLYWEDS
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

686
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,526
The perpetrator.

687
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,320
The witnesses.

688
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,284
The witness's father.

689
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,250
The victim's father.

690
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,627
And

691
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,589
the first detective who took on the case.

692
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,009
I understand what you mean.

693
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,802
I'll look into the black car.

694
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,183
How much do you know

695
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,810
about my accident?

696
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,237
I know enough. Just what I need to know.

697
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:36,027
A CRIME IS CONCEALED
BY ANOTHER CRIME

698
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,285
You put this here again.

699
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,120
My car feels amiss without it.

700
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,540
-It doesn't feel like my car.
-I get it. It's the company's taxi.

701
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,834
How is the new company? Is it okay?

702
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,920
I thought it'd be better
than working alone, but it's the same.

703
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,425
I don't know if it was a good idea
to enter a company.

704
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,555
Make sure you tell me
if the company ever treats you unfairly.

705
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,724
Don't forget your daughter is
a police officer.

706
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,355
You're the one
who shouldn't treat me unfairly.

707
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,275
What? When did I treat you unfairly?

708
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,777
There aren't many customers these days.

709
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,281
The only customer I have
always rides for free.

710
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,535
So you want your daughter
to pay for the fare.

711
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,287
All right then.

712
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,540
I was going to pay
because I felt uncomfortable.

713
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,877
Twist the taximeter and turn it on, sir.

714
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,755
My goodness, that isn't
how a modern taximeter works.

715
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,218
-I see that you're getting old.
-Of course. I've ridden a taxi for years.

716
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,054
I'll be late today.

717
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,431
There's a crackdown
on unlicensed taxis in Gangnam.

718
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,768
Are you doing that again?
Wasn't there a big crackdown last year?

719
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,895
It happened that way.

720
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,231
Because someone did a terrible job.

721
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,361
Everyone. Raise your glasses.

722
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,239
Drinks are on me,
so I'll kill you if you leave any behind.

723
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,540
-Goodness.
-That's wild.

724
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,377
PO-PO

725
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,920
Move.

726
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,297
Hey, move.

727
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,465
Move out of the way.

728
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,351
Yes, Father.

729
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,687
Where are you?
Why did you pick up so late?

730
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,399
I was working out.
I didn't notice an incoming call.

731
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,901
Tell Kyungsoo that I want to see him.

732
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,945
I'll give you a location.

733
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,448
What are you going to do?

734
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,908
Must you ask?

735
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,327
I'll teach him not to act up.

736
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,122
No, that's not what I meant.

737
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,667
Will you kill him?

738
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,839
That's none of your business.
Just do as I said.

739
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,465
Father, I--

740
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,426
Damn it.

741
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,542
Father wants to see you.

742
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,627
I'll send you a location,
so be there by 11 p.m.

743
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,101
I did it!

744
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,605
Yes, I did it!

745
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,536
Actor Han Jiho is being investigated

746
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,414
at Seoul Namgang Police Station

747
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,751
for doing drugs in an unlicensed taxi
early this morning.

748
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,880
How did Han Jiho think to do drugs
and drive into a police station wall?

749
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,091
Did he want to challenge law enforcement?

750
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,385
No, it was a homing instinct.

751
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:32,305
Something like,
"Jerks like me belongs in prison."

752
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:36,101
This place hasn't changed at all.

753
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,395
Director General Lee Taeju took the case,

754
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,480
but it looks like he only covered it up.

755
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,526
Why did the investigation come to nothing?

756
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,196
Well, high-ranking officials' children
were involved in a drug case.

757
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,783
I'm sure it was hard to investigate.
He probably received pressure too.

758
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,495
Director General Lee Taeju
is too successful for that to be the case.

759
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,373
He sucks up to Commissioner General Pyo.

760
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,292
Well, it worked out for the best.

761
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,003
Thanks to Han Jiho,
we got to investigate again.

762
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,174
Either way, let's get rid of drugs
and unlicensed taxis for good this time.

763
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,717
-Okay.
-Okay.

764
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,937
The number you have dialed is unavailable…

765
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,121
Hey, you punk.

766
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,956
-You punk.
-Die! Die!

767
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,086
-Get up, you punk.
-Get up.

768
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,842
Come here, you punk!

769
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,849
Catch him.

770
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,480
Come here, you punk.

771
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,943
That crazy bastard.

772
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,116
Stop right there, you punk.

773
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,076
-Hey!
-Hey!

774
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,786
-Go down.
-Darn it.

775
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,551
Okay. I got them.

776
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,802
Did they come out?

777
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,012
Yes. Hold on.

778
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,602
HAN KYUNGSOO

779
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,064
-Hello.
-Help me!

780
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,191
Help me. Pyo Jungwook--

781
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,242
-What is he doing?
-Why? What's going on?

782
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,786
Darn it. I think he caught on.

783
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,870
What?

784
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,333
This is driving me crazy.

785
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,586
Lieutenant, there's been
an accident near Sangil Interchange.

786
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,129
They requested for backup.

787
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,257
Okay. See you there.

788
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,240
Excuse me. Coming through.

789
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,158
Coming through. Thank you.

790
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,012

01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,230
CRASH

792
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,824
SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY JOO HYUN

793
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,466
He got into an accident while chasing

794
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,719
a car that hit a deliveryman and ran.

795
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,345
It's an unregistered car.

796
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,681
So we don't know who the actual driver is.

797
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,850
If we were a little late,
it would've vanished.

798
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,184
Look at this!

799
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,603
He's Commissioner General Pyo's son.

800
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,148
Why would the police dismiss it
despite the clear evidence?

801
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,275
I'm doing this because of you.

802
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,026
So that I don't harm your career!

803
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,445
I'll catch the culprit.

804
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,530
I also have a reason to do so.

805
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,199
-Pyo Jungwook, was it you?
-For your father's complete recovery!

806
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,368
You crazy bastard!

807
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,583
