You completely lost your pace.

28

To run like you would in the world championships, you have to maintain a pace of around 5k in fifteen minutes for 25k.

29
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,770
Even if you deviate from the fifteen minutes, it has to be within plus or minus ten seconds.

Congrats! Ah, your milk.

162
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,170
Thanks. Thanks to you, I got to know the taste of white milk.

163
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,520
Because of me?

164
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,200
Aren't you the one who has been putting a carton of milk in my locker since high school?

165
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,040
Me? Why?

166
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,530
- Let's go!
- Where?

167
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,850
- We need to hold a congratulation party! It's your first win since you entered university!
- It's fine.

168
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,840

Sangha, the one who agreed to be your pacemaker, isn't here.

189
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,980
But he usually doesn't come to these kinds of events.

190
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,620
Jin Won, at the national marathon next month, just run like you did today.

191
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,840
If you cut your time by just a little bit, you'll win right away.

192
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,400
Then you can bring back the ten million won prize ($10,000),

193
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,560
and we go straight to the World's.

Right, the bill.

That's because I taught him well. Enjoy the food, all of you!

I knew it. You don't know a thing about marathons.

207

It bled because your shirt had been rubbing on it.

208

- No, couple with me.

I washed them for him because they were dirty.

234
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,330
Is it because he's from a wealthy family?

235

If you like me, shouldn't you at least have some common knowledge about the marathons I run?

243
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,140
I can't wear these shoes anymore after running five hundred kilometers with them, stupid!

You can't tie your shoes too tight for a marathon.

520
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,140
You need to let your feet breathe. It's different from short distance races.

You were going to run with these shoes?

If he gets hurt, I might not be able to set a record.

It's because they feel more comfortable since I'm used to wearing them. I'll buy new ones when we go to Seoul.

Love is something that is possible when you're on equal footing.

951
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:19,630
When you are you and I am me.

952
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,380
Love?

953
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,250
I'm not sure because I haven't been in love before,

954
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:32,850
but I think this is love.

955
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:40,450
♫ Wait for you, because at anytime  ♫

956
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,690
♫ I'll be within reach of your gaze  ♫

957
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,940
I like you.

958
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:50,530
I love you, Sangha.

959
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:54,370
♫ all day you'll get to smile thinking of me ♫

960
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,900
I love you.

961
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:03,170
♫ I used to hope you wouldn't know of my gaze on you  ♫

962
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,360
♫  But not anymore  ♫

963
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:12,050
♫ Every little things will linger around you  ♫

964
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:15,130
♫ You will get to feel it ♫

965
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,760
♫ Quietly approaching me, you stroke my cheek ♫

966
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,260
Oh...

967
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:24,840
♫ The moment you look at the surprised me, ♫

968
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,580
What do we do?

969
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:33,300
I don't know. It's my first time on a date, so I don't really know.

970
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,180
And you think I've done this before?

971
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,350
Hyung, you've never been on a date?

972
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,840
I have.

973
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:43,680
♫ I'll be within reach of your gaze  ♫

974
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,860
N-No.

975
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:48,040
♫ Eyes on me ♫

976
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,120
I haven't.

977
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,860
♫ All day you'll get to smile thinking of me ♫

978
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,240
Hyung, why are you so cute?

979
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,390
♫ Baby you will be my love  ♫

980
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:01,480
For now, shall we take a walk?

981
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,410
That's a good idea.

982
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,630
♫  The moment our eyes meet  ♫

983
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:11,700
♫ Baby you will be my love, I will always be with you  ♫

984
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:15,830
♫ Baby you will be my love, you will get to smile  ♫

985
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:18,610
♫  I'll promise you ♫

986
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,080
Wait.

987
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,130
My heart is pounding.

988
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,450
Walking doesn't suit us.

989
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,640
Then, should we run?

990
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,080
♫ Fly high up into the sky ♫

991
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:44,940
Do you know what the similarity is between a marathon and love?

992
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,070
That once you start, you cannot stop?

993
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:50,330
♫ We're running to the end once more ♫

994
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:54,020
Be it in a marathon or in love, our heart keeps racing!

995
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:57,780
♫ Let's try, let's try, until my heart explodes ♫
