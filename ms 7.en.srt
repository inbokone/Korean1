1
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Do you like it here?

2
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,039
It has two stories, three bedrooms.

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,920
You don't have to sleep on a couch anymore.

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
And the good part is there's a kitchen,

5
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,360
so you can cook. Do you like it?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,320
Isn't this too big, darling?

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
Nope, Mom.

8
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,240
Auntie Nual, hello.

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,440
This is Auntie Nual, Mom.

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,440
She's the one who will be helping you with every chore.

11
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,920
And when I go to work,

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
she's the one who will take you to the hospital.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,880
Hello, Ma'am.

14
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh, no, just call me Ing.

15
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,320
I'll put your bags in your room.

16
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,600
Joe, let me ask you this.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,320
Where did you get the money to buy this house?

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,520
And also, Auntie Nual's wage?

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,720
Don't worry, Mom.

20
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,200
I got a really kind friend who lent me the money.

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
You borrowed? Why did you borrow the money?

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,000
Just for the old debt, we don't even know
if we can find a way to pay it off in this life...

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,680
My friend is a famous celebrity, Mom.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,880
And his family is very wealthy.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,320
This amount of money wouldn't do him any harm.

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,720
A famous celebrity? Tharn? Is it Tharn?

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
Which Tharn?

28
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,840
Tharn who used to be in the same agency as yours.

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,160
You can't remember him?

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,520
It's alright if you can't remember him. Nevermind.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
There are lots of trees too.

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
This is so good. I can grow vegetables and so many other plants.

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
Tonight.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Have you eaten?

35
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,520
A bit.

36
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Go take a shower.

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Sorry, bro.

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Just think that you're doing this for our Mom.

39
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Come here.

40
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
You like doing it from behind?

41
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
I see that you only do it in this position.

42
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,720
Mr. Ming.

43
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
Not a word.

44
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,680
Then excuse me. I should be going now.

45
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,000
No.

46
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Stay here.

47
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Beside me.

48
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,200
This is all you have in the fridge. Is it enough?

49
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
You're not a picky eater as I expected.

50
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Shit!

51
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,440
I got a music video shooting today. Please excuse me.

52
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Hurry back.

53
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I'll be waiting.

54
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Alright.

55
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,760
I am so sorry. The traffic was very bad.

56
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,360
What? You're not even popular and you're late already?

57
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm sorry

58
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
So how much have they shot?

59
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,560
How could we shoot anything? You just got here.

60
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,120
What? Aren't they shooting the main character first?

61
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm just a support character, only a few scenes for me.

62
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,160
Who says so?

63
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
I added a role for you.

64
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
You're now a main character

65
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,040
Really? And what's the role?

66
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
My boyfriend.

67
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
See you guys later, bye.

68
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,240
What are you looking at?

69
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm looking at the cute one.

70
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
Am I even you friend?

71
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
Well, I don't want that.

72
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
But I want you to be my boyfriend.

73
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Cut!

74
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,080
Alright, Nueng, move that light for me.

75
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Right away.

76
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,680
Okay. / Okay?

77
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,520
Was it okay, Pam?

78
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,480
Yes, it was good, Joe. Done.

79
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
So we're moving to the next scene?

80
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,160
Of course, Pam. We all go do our work.

81
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,040
Wait. Hey, you're pretty good.

82
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,240
Excuse me.

83
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Yes?

84
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
Could you replay the last past for me?

85
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Yes.

86
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
When walking out?

87
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes.

88
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Sol.

89
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,440
Let's do the touch-up.

90
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Alright.

91
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
May I join you?

92
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

93
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
The crew must have prepared a meal for you.

94
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,440
But I wanna join you, can I not?

95
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Of course.

96
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Right, do you remember about an old stunt named Joe?

97
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes.

98
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,360
Someone broke into his house the other day.

99
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,480
Oh, really?

100
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,440
Even in death, misfortune still finds him.

101
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Hello, yes?

102
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Where are you?

103
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm at the set, Mr. Ming.

104
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,240
Why didn't you tell me that you're shooting a music video with him?

105
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
What's wrong?

106
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,800
Hello, Mr. Ming?

107
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
Who's that?

108
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,520
Oh, so it is you.

109
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,200
Joe came here to shoot a music video with me.

110
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,440
I'll let him call you when we're free.

111
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,800
And why the fuck are you sticking your nose in?

112
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Ming.

113
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,360
From now on, I order you to not get involved with him at all.

114
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,280
But we're under the same agency.

115
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't forget who's giving everything to you now.

116
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Alright, I understand that now.

117
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,160
Sol!

118
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Ming, hey!

119
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,119
Get up!

120
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Stop! Stop it, both of you!

121
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,680
A new life...but why do I feel like everything...

122
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
is going back to the way it was?

123
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Hey, Joe.

124
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,760
What are you doing here today?

125
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
Hello, Wut.

126
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,760
Yeah...

127
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,240
Tong and the director called me in for the briefing for the important scene.

128
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,960
Tong's project?

129
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,000
I got some time. I'll tag along.

130
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,440
In case Tong's being sneaky.

131
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,520
I think he's kinda similar.
We could shoot from the other side. Should be okay.

132
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
No, it's not similar.

133
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
Oh, Wut, hello.

134
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Hello.

135
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,800
Hello.

136
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Wut, hello.

137
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,760
So we're the same old team now!

138
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
What team?

139
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Well, this is the sequel to Tong's first movie.

140
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,920
Just like when you came to take care of your stand-in like that.

141
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,680
Joe.

142
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Why didn't you tell me that it's this project?

143
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
I've realized just now too.

144
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,600
The reason I called you in to talk about...

145
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,080
is the legendary fencing scene from the first movie.

146
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,320
The fans love it so much.

147
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
So I want to recreate this scene.

148
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,080
But last time, Tong played it himself.

149
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,800
I think it's not really safe.

150
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,920
So this movie, he'll replace Tong.

151
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,440
Alright.

152
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
But this scene is what made Tong well-known.

153
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,080
So you, don't mess it up.

154
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,360
Messing up Tong's name...

155
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Right, but we still have a problem about the location.

156
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,360
The location that we used to shoot that movie...

157
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
doesn't allow us to get in anymore.

158
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,680
So I had my staff look for a new location.

159
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,040
But still, it's not as beautiful as that one.

160
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Oh, Joy, hello.

161
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
Hello.

162
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
Hello. Hello.

163
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
Everyone...

164
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Tong has good news to tell you.

165
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,960
I happened to talk to the owner of the old location.

166
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,720
He allowed us to use the place.

167
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
Hey, really?

168
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,000
Alright, let's go. Let's pack up!

169
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,560
Let's go make a legend again.

170
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,400
Go! Go! Go!

171
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,600
I have work later.

172
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,360
I gotta go now.

173
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you so much, Wut, for today.

174
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,880
Joe, how did you get here?

175
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,080
Oh, I'm Tong's stand-in.

176
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,160
Oh, so during the passing two years, you changed to this way?

177
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,880
And you knew that I was here so you came here?

178
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,560
Er...who are you?

179
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Oh, are you an actor in Tong's agency?

180
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,840
Wait, what kind of joke is this, Joe? It's not funny.

181
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,880
You should be moving on from me already.

182
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,120
Excuse me, I had an accident two years ago.

183
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,520
I had a brain concussion.

184
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,040
I can't remember things in the past.

185
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me guess...

186
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,280
You wouldn't want me to remember it too, right?

187
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,080
Joe.

188
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
I will pretend I believe you.

189
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,760
My name is Tharn. I'm a supporting actor.

190
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
In the past, you and I, we're friends.

191
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,200
I hope that you can think of something.

192
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,640
I won't tell anyone.

193
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,800
See you around.

194
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,160
So is this the Tharn Mom talked about?

195
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,800
I'm going to work out of town for a week, Mom.

196
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,520
If you need anything, tell Auntie Nual to assist you.

197
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,480
I'll fold that for you.

198
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,960
Thank you, Mom.

199
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,760
Right, today a guy named Tharn say hello to me.

200
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,640
And...did he tell you anything?

201
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,280
No.

202
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,880
That's good. He isn't a very trustworthy guy.

203
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,480
That's good. He isn't a very trustworthy guy.

204
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,280
Is he my ex-boyfriend, Mom?

205
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Mom.

206
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Tell me.

207
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Please.

208
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Two years ago, you guys were dating.

209
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
And you and I, we fought about it.

210
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,160
You were upset about me so you...

211
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
jumped into the river.

212
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
That means the accident two years ago...

213
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
was about this?

214
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,160
When you were in a coma,

215
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,560
I promised myself, Son...

216
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,040
that I would not stop you from anything, ever.

217
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,640
I can accept anything for who you are,
no matter who you're dating...what gender and all that.

218
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
For you to just wake up...

219
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm sorry.

220
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,640
It's alright, Mom.

221
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,800
It's been a long time.

222
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,360
Joe, you really can date anyone.

223
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,560
But please, don't let it be Tharn?

224
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,400
It's not because he's a guy.

225
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,240
But he used to use you to bring him into this industry.

226
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,600
And when he had his way in, he left you.

227
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,320
Joe, do you know that during the past two years...

228
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,760
he never visited you, not even once...

229
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,120
Mom, don't you worry.

230
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,720
Because right now, the only person that I love is sitting here.

231
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,800
I just want you to be happy, that's all.

232
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't want anything else.

233
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,360
Thanks, darling.

234
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
I'll get you the toothbrush.

235
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,760
Thank you.

236
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,680
I have something to talk to you tonight.

237
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Thanks for the information.

238
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Yes, Mr. Ming.

239
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Mr. Ming, do you have anything with me?

240
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,000
How long are you gonna hide it from me?

241
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,840
What are you talking about?

242
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,440
You had an accident and was in a hospital for two years.

243
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,680
Why didn't you tell me this?

244
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,480
I don't think it's important.

245
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,840
So I didn't tell you about it.

246
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,880
And do you remember what date did you have an accident?

247
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,640
No, I don't.

248
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
All I know is that when I woke up, I didn't have the same memory.

249
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Was it the 13th of August?

250
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Hello.

251
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,240
I know that I had an accident two years ago.

252
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,160
But I don't remember what date it was.

253
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,720
And when you were in a coma, did you dream about anybody?

254
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Mr. Ming.

255
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
What exactly do you want from me?

256
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Nevermind.

257
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Pack up for me.

258
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
It's in the bedroom.

259
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Alright.

260
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,840
I bought it online. They said that this one is the top and newly released.

261
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,720
This is just a standard. Here, this is the top one.

262
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,560
Alright then, I'll just...buy you a new one.

263
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,880
That's okay. Even it's not the top one, but I like it.

264
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
What are you doing?

265
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,320
Er...I'm looking for cotton buds.

266
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,480
No. Get out!

267
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,760
Mr. Ming, but I'm almost done packing.

268
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,800
I'll do it myself.

269
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,000
I told you to get out!

270
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,280
And...won't it be too normal?

271
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,680
Can I not like something normal?

272
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Wear it for me.

273
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Do you like it?

274
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,600
Mr. Ming, I'll go stay with the crew.

275
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Why?

276
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't want anyone to see us in a bad way.

277
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
Are you tired?

278
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,560
I saw you were sleeping during the ride.

279
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Oh, please.

280
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,160
Yes? Calm. I'll check if we all are here now.

281
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,200
Joe, ah, Joe is here. Sit here.

282
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Okay, I guess everyone is here now.

283
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,080
Okay, I'll arrange the bedrooms for you.

284
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,160
Two people for each room, alright?

285
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,480
I'll call you as a pair now.

286
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,640
Starting for the art team, come and get the key cards first.

287
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
And then...

288
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,960
At first, I thought you wouldn't come along.

289
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,800
I was about to tell the screenwriter to cut the scene out.

290
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,600
Well, I'm kinda free so I came.

291
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,880
Ming, do you remember about the resort project I told you about?

292
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,880
Oh, the one that's in a reserved forest?

293
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Yeah.

294
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,560
Right now, the owner sneaked his way and got the title deed.

295
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
What are you eating?

296
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,400
You don't have to try to be close to me.

297
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
Because I won't be able to remember you anyhow.

298
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Don't you want to know what we both had been through?

299
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,600
That won't be necessary.

300
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
Because if you wanted tell me that,

301
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,080
two years ago, when I was in a coma, you would've come visit me.

302
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,320
Joe.

303
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,800
I've put lots of money into my new movie project...

304
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
so I...

305
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,960
don't have any more money to invest.

306
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,920
And, May told me to talk to you in case you're interested.

307
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,080
So we may invest together.

308
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,840
Ming...

309
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,760
Ming!

310
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,400
Are you listening?

311
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
Oh, yes.

312
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm listening.

313
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,000
I think we should talk about this later.

314
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm full. Excuse me.

315
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,680
Hey, Tharn.

316
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,280
You seem to be so close to my stand-in.

317
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,440
Er...well, we used to be friends.

318
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,280
Oh, really? But why doesn't he seem like he wants to be your friend?

319
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Oh, he happened to have an accident.

320
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,000
He lost his memory so he couldn't remember me.

321
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Oh.

322
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,960
But seriously, I can tell...that you and he...

323
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,200
weren't really just friends, right?

324
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,240
Don't worry, I'm not saying anything.

325
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,960
I just want you to remind him of what you guys were.

326
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't want him around my brother-in-law.

327
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
So what would you like me to do?

328
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
You know him?

329
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,480
He said he's my friend.

330
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
But I can't remember him.

331
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Just friends?

332
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,000
I really don't know. Is there anything, Mr. Ming?

333
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,240
Tonight, spend a night with me.

334
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,640
That's not possible, Mr. Ming.

335
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
I don't want anyone to notice us.

336
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,840
So what? I don't care.

337
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,440
You don't, but I do.

338
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Please let me work in peace.

339
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,320
Oh, Joe, let's go see the blocking.

340
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,199
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Ming.

341
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Excuse me.

342
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Let's go.

343
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Right, let me brief you a little bit.

344
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,400
Of course.

345
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,360
So this scene, you're gonna play Tong.

346
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,040
Alright.

347
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,400
Tong wants it to be exactly like his first movie.

348
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
I tried to set everything as it was.

349
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,480
Including your movement.

350
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,320
Yes.

351
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,520
Then...the camera crane must be on this side, right?

352
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,280
It shouldn't be here.

353
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,880
And how do you know about that?

354
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,360
Tong was the one who played it,
he told me it's supposed to be like this.

355
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,200
He's right.

356
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
And how do you know that, Chai?

357
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,720
Hey! Of course, I know.
I was there when the first movie was shot.

358
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,080
The crane must be over there just like he said.

359
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,640
But Tong wants it to be like this.

360
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,000
Then let it be.

361
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,440
Just do what Tong says.

362
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,040
Hey, bro!

363
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,760
Yes?

364
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,600
How did you know? Were you at the set that day?

365
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,600
Oh, I just randomly guessed.

366
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,880
Guessed?

367
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Yes.

368
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,760
Okay.

369
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,040
Spend a night with me tonight.

370
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,440
Hey, how did you get here?

371
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Well, I'm your roommate. Why are you confused?

372
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,640
What roommate?

373
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,640
My roommate is a crew, not an actor like you.

374
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, I don't know. They told me to be here.

375
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
But I didn't come here empty-handed.

376
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,360
I got some beers for you too. Want some?

377
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
No.

378
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,600
I got an important scene tomorrow.

379
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,480
C'mon, relax, just a bit.

380
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,680
A celebration for our reunion.

381
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,400
Right, and how did you know Mr. Ming?

382
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,280
Why are you asking?

383
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,120
Well, I see that you two are pretty close.

384
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,080
We shot a fashion set together, that's all.

385
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,800
Oh?

386
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,160
But I know that you two are closer than that.

387
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
Or you two wouldn't ride here together.

388
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,640
Why do you like sticking your nose into other people's business?

389
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
You're not different from me.

390
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,240
In the past, you told me that I was living off someone.

391
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
Right now, you're no different.

392
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,200
We both aren't alike.

393
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
Don't say things you don't know.

394
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,120
No, you're the one who knows nothing...
what we'd been through together.

395
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,400
But it's alright. Tonight...

396
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
I'll recall your memory.

397
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,760
Let's have fun.

398
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,720
What are you doing, huh?

399
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,840
Or do you want me to tell Tong that you're living off his brother-in-law?

400
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Hey, hey, hey, stop! Hey!

401
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Hey!

402
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,280
Don't mess with him!

403
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
Ming!

404
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,000
Mr. Ming!

405
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,360
Mr. Ming, calm down, Mr. Ming!

406
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Mr. Ming!

407
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,600
Don't forget who you belong to!

408
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,600
Although how much you want him, you need to control yourself.

409
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,560
Mr. Ming, I'm not that kind of person.

410
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,280
He was the one who tried to do something.

411
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,360
You thought I didn't know that you used to be together?

412
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,720
Well, that's the past.

413
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,360
I can't even remember it.

414
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,440
Oh, so you were trying to recall the memory together earlier?

415
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,640
Mr. Ming.

416
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,520
Right?!

417
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,240
Can you calm down first? This is all a misunderstanding.

418
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,080
Calm down.

419
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,720
Mr. Ming.

420
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,920
Listen to me.

421
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,840
Earlier, I felt like he was talking about you to threaten me.

422
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,920
About me?

423
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,640
Yes.

424
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,360
He wasn't like this before.

425
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,880
Someone might have threatened him.

426
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,200
Because that person doesn't like when you're around me.

427
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Who would dare do something like that to me? Huh?

428
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,080
The only person I can think of right now...

429
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
is Tong.

430
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Watch it.

431
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,360
Who do you think you are?

432
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,720
Why would he care about someone like you?

433
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,960
Right, you're a family.

434
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,120
You know each other more than you know me.

435
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Shut up!

436
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,400
I bought you, so you can wag your tail for me.

437
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,080
Not biting me like this.

438
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,760
Right, then, go on.

439
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Ask me for a paw! Ask!

440
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,600
You want me to be your dog? C'mon!

441
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Alright!

442
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,600
Is there anything? It's so loud that I could hear you.

443
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Ming, what happened?

444
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Ming!

445
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
Ming, what happened?

446
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Ming!

447
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,080
Ming, are you alright?

448
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,760
It's nothing.

449
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,880
Are you sure that it's nothing?

450
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Yes.

451
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,240
Excuse me.

452
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,960
Get out!

453
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,600
Huh?

454
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,480
Get out!

455
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,240
Get out! I told you to get out! Out!

456
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,000
Get out!

457
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,040
I know what you're gonna say, but you don't have to.

458
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,720
I know. Even your Dad and Mom say something, you don't listen.

459
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,800
But I'm really worried about you.

460
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,920
I'd like you to be my lovely same old bro.

461
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,400
If there's nothing else, you should go back to you room.

462
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Ming.

463
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,520
You've changed, Ming.

464
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,760
You've never been like this.

465
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,680
Is it because of Joe?

466
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,920
That's why you're being very stubborn to me.

467
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,960
I told you so many times, do not talk about Joe with me!

468
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,840
Move on, Ming.

469
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,560
Joe's been dead for a long time.

470
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,840
And are you trying to find someone to be his replacement?

471
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,200
What did you say?

472
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,640
Wasn't it because of you and me?

473
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,680
Joe had no future and he had to run away.

474
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,640
I never blamed you because you're my brother-in-law.

475
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,880
But if you talk about Joe again,

476
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,280
I will never let you get away easily.

477
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,360
Okay.

478
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,520
Then, I won't disturb you anymore.

479
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,440
Joe is not dead.

480
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,880
He's still somewhere out there.

481
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,480
I just need to find him.

482
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,160
Make me a coffee too.

483
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,720
Thanks.

484
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,720
Well...

485
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,800
Excuse me.

486
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,880
I need to be on standby.

487
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,440
So, are you ready?

488
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,600
Yes, I am.

489
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,280
Thank you.

490
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,120
Hey, do they give you a credit for playing this scene?

491
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,720
Yes.

492
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,720
Why?

493
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,320
Oh, nothing. That's good.

494
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,560
I just don't wanna make mistake for the second time.

495
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,760
You got this.

496
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,040
Thank you.

497
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,120
I've heard that this stand-in is playing for Tong for the first time.

498
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,400
Will he be able to handle all that?

499
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,520
And this is an important scene.

500
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,600
That's true, if he can't play it...

501
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,600
Tong must play it himself.

502
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,840
Tong...

503
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,480
Even if he plays himself,

504
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,800
it won't be exactly like in the first movie.

505
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,520
Why is that?

506
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,520
Nothing. I'll go to the restroom.

507
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,560
What's wrong with him?

508
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Mr. Ming, is there anything?

509
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What?

510
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,920
You talked as if in the first movie...

511
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,200
Tong wasn't the one who played the fencing scene himself...

512
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Did I say that?

513
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,920
Please, just tell me the truth.

514
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,280
Did Tong really play that scene himself?

515
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,280
I can't say anything!

516
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,280
Speak!

517
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,680
Let me put it this way.

518
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,360
If Tong really played it, why would he turn his back?

519
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,200
And if it's not Tong's back, then whose back was it?

520
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,680
It's normal...

521
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,360
for the production to say that the main lead played the scene himself.

522
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,360
For promotional reason.

523
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,680
Especially, a new stuntman...

524
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,320
who still can't even talk for himself.

525
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,600
I was the one who told him...

526
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,320
not to take the credit.

527
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
In exchange of being the full-time stand-in for Tong.

528
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,640
Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
That you got to play the important scene instead of Tong?

530
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,160
I see that you're close to him. So I didn't want to tell you.

531
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,760
Thank you, Ming. This is the best Christmas in my life.

532
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,040
Why didn't you choose me?

533
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,000
And how about you? What am I to you?

534
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,920
Tong's stand-in?

535
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,520
Don't be so full of yourself.

536
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,800
You're just a stand-in.

537
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,040
It's my fault. I didn't know that I was just a stand-in.

538
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,680
Although I'm not as good as Tong,

539
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,600
but I got my dignity.

540
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,280
I don't want to be just a stand-in on and off the screen, understood?

541
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,160
Joe, I'm sorry.

542
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,960
It's always been you...

543
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,120
I'm sorry.

544
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,720
Please come back to me. I'm begging you.

545
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,600
Joe, I'm sorry.

546
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm really sorry.

547
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,600
Please come back to me.

548
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
I'm sorry.

549
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,400
Joe..
