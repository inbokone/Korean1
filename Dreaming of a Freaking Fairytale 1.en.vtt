(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.729
What's up with the story of Cinderella in the 21st century,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.800
the era of Metaverse, you ask?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.448
That's because there lived a pitiful woman,

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.359
the deity was watching over her to shape her fate to be Cinderella.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.640
But there's something special about her.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.719
Before I show that to her,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.920
I'd like to point out that this drama isn't for innocent kids.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.079
This is for ambitious adults who are full of dreams.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.678
Dear kidults, come and check this out.

(Hanyang University Hospital)

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.038
Let me begin the story of a brand-new Cinderella.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.530
Here it goes.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.159
Excuse me.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
Dad.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.520
If you leave me like this, I'll kill you!

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.920
Don't worry.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.959
I won't leave you like this.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.200
You'd better. Don't leave me.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.719
Only a dad with no conscience would leave a daughter like this.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:39.799
Dad...

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.640
Dad.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.840
Dad!

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.840
Dad!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.239
With her dad gone,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.640
she only had her stepmother and stepsisters by her side.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.719
Honey.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.879
Is she now off to a tough life just like Cinderella?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.090
I wonder how much she'll end up crying.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.280
Don't cry, Shin Jae Rim.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.560
Living is harder than dying.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.840
If you cry now, how will you get through your life?

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.680
Her dad who was watching over her from the sky must have been sad...

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.810
that he got up.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.319
Get up.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.599
Get up.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.960
Get up.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.439
Get up!

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.960
(20 years ago from now)

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.360
- One. - One.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.919
Gosh.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960
Get up.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.319
One. Get up.

(Shin Ramyun)

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.519
Cinderella moved into her stepmother's house with her dad.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.719
How adorable.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.319
Jae Rim. Welcome.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.399
- Here comes the rib. - Gosh.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.799
She could never eat comfortably because she didn't feel welcome.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.120
- Try this. - This is so tasty.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.198
- The japchae too. - Gosh.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.839
But now that her dad passed away on top of everything,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.170
things must be worse for her.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.439
Mom, have some food.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.439
You haven't been eating for days.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.639
She's eating as if nothing's wrong.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.279
Why aren't you eating?

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.800
Someone like me doesn't deserve to have food.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.439
I wanted to look good to him even in his last moments.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.439
So I got the Botox shots and did everything I could to look good.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.959
Why did he have to die that day?

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.399
Why do I even bother living?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.319
If you eat, you can live. Go on and eat.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.610
Mom, have the salted fish. Here you go.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.319
- What was that? - Are you not well?

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:18.519
Do you want to go to the hospital and get a medical checkup too?

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.879
It's not my physical health.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.319
I can't live my life without him. That's why.

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:27.610
How am I going to fill his absence?

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.439
My stepmother genuinely loved my dad.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.519
But she didn't love me.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.240
I should be smart and leave the house as soon as possible.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.639
I...

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.839
prepared my last present...

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.560

Don't take the long way around in life.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.279
Take the shortcut.

Had I worked less in my younger days,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.720
I wouldn't have died so soon like this.

If you rely on other people,

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.120

in the net profit of Chungdam Heaven this month.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800
Really?

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.319
It went down by 200 percent.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.480
At this rate, you may have to close down this business.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.119
This is great news. It's all going as planned.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.240
What on earth do you mean?

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.600
Why are we considered wealthy?

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:55.958
Because we have a lot of money.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.719
If so-called wealthy people fret over money...

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.319
and struggle because of money, they can't be called wealthy.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.680

You're not some third-generation member of a wealthy family,

Right? You think so too, don't you?

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.480
It's telling me not to accept random people.

There are all kinds of people in this tough world.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.999
We must be careful.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.159
But still. We must make money.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.960
Since the business isn't going well, I shall give...

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.360
a ten-percent raise to everyone.

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.330

After reading his will, I felt like a fool for feeling sad.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.360
You know, my dad hadn't done anything to help me.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.638
I know it's a cliche, but if he wrote he was sorry...

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:33.479
and he loved me, he wouldn't have made me angry.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.519
But did he have to write that I couldn't succeed on my own?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.330
He was never a dad to me.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:40.599
He was like the armpit hair. He was completely useless.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.558
Give him some credit. An employee at Chungdam Heaven...

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:45.759
recently married a rich guy. It was quite the scandal.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.919
I guess stuff like that still happens.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.919
But do you think it can happen to me too?

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.600
That rich guy had to be crazy first.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.960
You never know what can happen.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:57.399
That's right.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:01.559
Who knew that my useless dad would die so young like this?

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.960
I won't have to worry about his retirement at least.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.960
Just be sad if you're sad.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.960
Why would I be sad?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.399

How could you blatantly tell me to become Cinderella?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.360
What kind of dad would say that?

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.240
How could you say that to your own daughter?

My daughter.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:11.159
Feeling embarrassed won't help your life in any way.

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:13.240
The courage to overcome your embarrassment...

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.399
will put food on the table.

Am I some beggar on the street?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.158
Then you shouldn't have died, leaving me all alone here.

How do you expect me to live on my own?

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:23.679
My daughter.

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:26.159
Don't you worry about anything.

There's one more thing I prepared for you.

Save me!

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.399
Save me!

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.399

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:28.679
so the wedding will be held there.

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.320
Sure. Let's go...

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:34.320
and check out what kind of place Chungdam Heaven is.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.360
Hello, sir.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.639
Sir.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.840
Did you bring Chairman Ko's umbrella even today?

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.439
But still. You don't have to worry...

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.200
about protecting yourself at a wedding.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.919
I must be more cautious when there are more people. Okay?

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.918
People are the most dangerous.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.600
Then you shouldn't have come to the wedding.

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.439
I ought to come.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.200
It's a wedding at none other than Chungdam Heaven.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:21.240
Well, I'm not here to congratulate the couple, though.

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:38.639
That's dangerous.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.440
If you're cautious about everything, don't you get tired?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.839
This place is filled with flowers.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.399
Why bring more flowers to a wedding? Isn't that odd?

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.639
Smile. One, two, three.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.638
- Okay. Let's take one more. - Congratulations.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:49.639
- One, two... - Thank you.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.720
You look beautiful.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.440
How could love change?

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.320
You will not go through with this wedding.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.360
Unless you want me to plaster this place with your old photos,

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:02.919
come with me. Darn it.

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:05.440
In life,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.840
having suspicions can never hurt.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.639
Safety first.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.039
What do you want?

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:14.399
Get out of my face when I'm asking nicely.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.720
I never said I wanted to talk.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.039
Darn it.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.039
Gosh.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.399
Your stupid fantasy of love made you do such an awful thing.

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.200
Thank you.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.038
- Smile. - Oh, my.

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:48.879
Prince Cha Min knows how to fight pretty well.

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:49.919
He's like a handsome prince.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.720
The bride will enter now.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.398
But why...

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:49.519
do all the brides have to walk down the aisle with their dads?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.919
It's not like they need help walking.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.240
It's an old-fashioned custom.

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:58.559
By the way, I am jealous indeed.

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:01.360
She met the one in her 20s...

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:04.759
and gets to start her Round Two at a fancy place like this.

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.039
"Round Two?" Life isn't a game.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.679
Of course, it is.

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:11.599
For Round One, everything is random.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.038
Like having good parents or not.

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.398
For Round Two, it's about making the right choice.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.840
Like choosing the right man for your marriage.

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:19.798
To move on from this awfully miserable Round One,

00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:20.960
I must get married?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.678
Of course, you could pave your own path...

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:25.559
and finish the game all on your own.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.599
But life is a lonely and long game. So having a partner...

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.840
during this bumpy ride would come in handy. You know?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.440
I just want to log out of this game.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.080
You look gorgeous.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.799
Congratulations.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Gosh.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.120
She's so beautiful.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.798
- Sir. - What?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.879
Check out your three o'clock.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.919
- It's 3:30pm now? - No. Your 3 o'clock.

00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.799
You're right.

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.840
She's like...

00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:00.799
a smooth marble stone.

00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:23.759
There are so many stones here.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.650
(Motto: Consider women stones.)

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:33.118
Everyone, today is a special showtime of love.

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.278
- I'm envious. - Welcome to the wedding...

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:37.078
- She's pretty. - of Groom Park Byung Hoon...

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.759
and Bride Lee Ha Jin.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.919
They are the perfect couple just like the cheese on the pizza.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920
- Yes. - Yes.

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.519
We hope that every second they spend together is as fun as a party.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:51.649
I can't believe his pumpkin kick meant this pumpkin cake.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.410
Seriously. Are you kidding me?

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.519
Darn it. It looks like it would taste awful.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.599
What an ugly cake.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.410
Okay. Wait for me outside.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.559
Gosh, how beautiful.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.000
You're all I have.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960
I can just throw that out.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.650
What's this?

00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.079
"Hermes?"

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.278
Was this the good fortune I was supposed to experience today?

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.519
No. Her pumpkin dream...

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:55.680
brought her something bigger than just a luxury handkerchief.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.000
You're pregnant?

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:00.200
It was a conception dream?

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.720
It was the day he gave me this ring.

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:07.079
We vowed eternal love for each other again that day.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.799
He didn't have any money. I wonder where he got the money.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.079
He really did everything for me.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.479
He literally did everything including borrowing money.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480
(Boram Funeral Assistance)

00:19:16.481 --> 00:19:17.650
He only lived for love.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.890
(Our condolences)

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.759
I thought he would survive it no matter what.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.890
I guess this was the end for him.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.359
By the way,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.960
he borrowed a small sum of money from me.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.519
(If you have some money, could I borrow 30,000 dollars?)

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.519
(I only have 20,000 dollars. If you need, you can borrow that.)

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.960
(- Thank you. I'll pay you back. - I wired the money to you. Check.)

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.440
I'll pay it back...

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240
little by little.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:00.650
Just like that,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.599
the only thing he left for me was debt.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.440
Not only did he give me a baby sibling,

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.920
but he also squandered our house before leaving this world.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.039
He was a great man in a different sense.

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:13.410
Sir. Stop putting the stickers on them.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.960
I'm going to hit you!

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:19.890
I'm going to rip you into pieces when I see you again.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.480
He's already dead. Too bad.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.440
Gosh. You're his daughter. Get out of my sight.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.920
Hey, stop it.

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:31.799
Come on!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.599
- "Don't hit with flowers." - This is so annoying.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.278
"Hit them with your fists." That was...

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:38.119
- her second sister's motto. - Our family is broke now.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.439
As there was no one she could physically beat up,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.319
she threw a bigger tantrum than usual.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.199
- Mom. - I brought your meal.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200
Yes!

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.480
I was starving.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.519
- Weren't you starving? - I was.

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:29.960
- Three, two, one. Ta-da! - Three, two, one. Ta-da!

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.240
I love this dish.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:37.839
- Is it good? - Yes, it is. It's the best.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.480
Try some of the rolled omelette.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.039
This tastes amazing. How did you make it this good?

(Entire class accepted through rolling admissions in 2015)

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.119
I regret to inform you that...

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.599
the vacation special lecture is 1,000 dollars.

Excuse me?

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.279
But I worked hard to earn money to take the vacation lecture.

00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:10.119
Attending this academy is not cheap.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.200
Did you talk with your parents?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.720
Had I taken that class back then,

00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:20.559
would I have found my calling...

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.720
and gotten a job?

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.799
Forget it.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.920
I would have succeeded if it was meant to be.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.599
Why did that man stand surety for our house?

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.960
Why must I go through this because of him?

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.759
Can't Jae Rim take care of it alone?

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.759
- It was because of me. - Why was it because of you?

Do you like that man that much?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.640
He stood surety for your aunt.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.199
Even I, her sister, didn't want to do it.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.839
But he did it for her and me to get along well.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.000
- Did Aunt go down? - That's right.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.758
My plan wasn't to tell you so you could enjoy her kimchi.

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:00.960
But here I am, telling you.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.720
And even if he hadn't stood surety,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.079
I would have eventually.

But I'm not reading the mood and going with them.

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.680
Isn't there anywhere else I can go?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.839
I want a place that will welcome me with open arms.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:30.720
How about Chungdam Heaven where bubbles and crankiness...

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.920
are filling the air?

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:41.920
Why don't you just smoke?

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:43.680
The bubbles are making the floor slippery.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.960
I can't be distressed by smoking, can I?

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.480
I'm the icon of self-control.

A smoking prince?

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.279
That looks wrong.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.880
Then, blow the bubbles outside.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.559
Bubbles are banned inside.

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:58.720
Now that I think about it,

my worker falling in love with a member...

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:02.039
and leaving this place behind my back...

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:04.519
is a dishonour to me.

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:06.240
Honour has nothing to do with it.

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:10.759
You have no idea how much pain I'm in.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.400
Prince Cha Min has no idea...

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.759
that the real pain is being penniless.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:37.759
To all this generation's...

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.439
countless new Cinderella without money or a house,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.479
(Boeun 2)

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.759
hang in there!

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960
Gosh.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.160
(Boeun 2)

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:58.680
I'm using the bed. You can sleep on the floor.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.279
I can't. You should sleep on the floor.

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:03.799
Your body will work as a sleeping bag, no?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.199
You little... Should I knock you out every single night?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.720
We won't have to fight about who is older.

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:15.559
To have to share a room with her without an end date.

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:18.519
Moving made you cold, right, Sosik?

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:20.480
The rent in Seoul...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.680
is impossible to handle. It's crazier than that wacko.

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:28.880
The rent in Seoul made the wacko put up with the situation...

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:32.200
and even made the pregnant woman work hard.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.480
Ms. Hwang. Is it all right when you're pregnant?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960
Of course.

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:42.279
The world doesn't envy pregnant women.

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.640
I must dance when my body is still light.

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:46.640
Everyone.

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.519
Let's do it.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880
Great.

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:56.680
How flexible.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:00.720
Walk backward. Like this.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.759
Shake your body.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.159
Do it until you lose your belly fat.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.159
Faster. Shake your body.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.239
That's it. Faster.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.319
Until you lose...

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:13.599
- Oh, no! - Ms. Hwang!

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.960
- Gosh. - What now?

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:16.599
Are you okay?

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:26.200
It made your heart drop, right?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.359
Both your mom and the baby are okay.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.640
Stay by her side. It'll bring her spirits up.

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:36.640
I will.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.440
Jae Rim.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.518
- You didn't have to... - Mom.

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:57.798
Come in such a hurry.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:27:00.440
I thought something had happened.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.640
Being pregnant at such an old age...

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.039
is causing everyone trouble, right?

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.240
I'll treat you well...

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.480
even without your dad, Jae Rim.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.640
Dad knows.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.880
He appeared in my dream and gave me a pumpkin.

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.240
It must've been a conception dream.

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.799
Your dad gave it to you in your dream?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.079
A pumpkin?

00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:33.319
He did.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.359
So don't worry too much.

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:40.759
He gave you a pumpkin?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.759
Thank you, Jae Rim.

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:48.880
I must help this naive woman from now on.

00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:51.920
But how?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.920
My goodness. Oh no, dear.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.680
You're hungry, right?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.400
I'll get you food.

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:07.000
Just hang in there a bit more.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.960
Give her the milk.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.640
Hwa Jin.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.479
How can you eat the baby's food?

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.439
But I'm starving, okay?

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.480
Hwa Jin.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.960
Dust it off into the formula.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.480
I'm hungry.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.240
At this rate, everyone will starve to death.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880
What do I do?

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:36.119
A business?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.559
But I need money to do it.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.279
Getting a job?

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.799
I won't even get an interview with my zero experience.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.839
The older I get,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.519
the more responsibility I must take on.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.960
What on earth can I do?

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.119
Darn it.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.079
Stop after one last try.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.559
You can't beat the claw machine.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.759
And I don't need a doll.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.880
Daddy is a fool.

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:40.799
See that? Life is unpredictable.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.519
You must try until the end.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200
Jae Rim.

00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:48.160
Life is a game of chance.

(Recruiting New Angel Managers)

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.680
For Round Two, it's about making the right choice.

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:08.119
Like choosing the right man for your marriage.

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:12.079
Fine. Let's give it a shot.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.680

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.319
I can do it.

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:30.839
Did I gain weight?

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:39.039
She was someone who knew...

00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:41.720
how to make full use of the resources around her.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880
Oh, no.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.559
Free sports equipment is at the park,

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:49.319
befitting the country with a national warm-up routine.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.680
While others paid to get personal training,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.159
she learned secret skills from the expert neighbours.

It fits.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.480
Yes. Working out paid off.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.720
I kind of look like a model.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.200
What's this?

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.200
Did I work out too much?

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:14.200
But my shoulders feel great.

Let's starve.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.519
Starving.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.359
Despite knowing it's bad,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.519
it is the commonly known poisoned chalice for those on a diet.

Life is like that.

00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:46.960
It makes people do things,

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.960
even when they know they're bad.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:11.960
It smells, Hwa Jin. Eat your meal outside.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.038
You should leave.

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:15.518
I have the right to eat in my room.

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:16.559
You really...

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:20.960
And you stink, too!

00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:23.400
- What do you mean? - Your fart stinks.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.240
Stop eating, will you?

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.880
Am I bloated because I've only been eating vegetables?

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.440
Like herbivores eating nonstop throughout the day,

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.920
the vegetarian Hwa Jin...

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:39.039
kept eating...

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.759
because she felt hungry every moment.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.720
I need my sports drink.

What are you doing?

00:34:24.809 --> 00:34:27.289
Are you mad? Weren't you holding back at any cost?

00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:30.159
Weren't you only eating vegetables?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.238
Don't eat such a sloppy meal.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.360
How come?

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.639
Let's mix.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.919
We should mix everything in a big bowl.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.960
- Yes! - Good.

00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:43.399
I'll pour in all the ham.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.078
- Do it. - In goes all the ham.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:46.199
I love it.

Your aunt's kimchi...

00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:54.599
Should I pour it in?

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.199
Get rid of it from my sight.

Let's get rid of it in our stomachs.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.118
It's such an eyesore.

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:05.999
That's it. Let's stuff them in our mouths.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.638
- We'll get rid of it like that! - Yes!

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.238
Let's dig in.

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:11.440
In life, today's happiness...

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:13.199
can become tomorrow's misfortune.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.959
- It's making me tear up. - Isn't it good?

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.960
However, this main character is optimistic.

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:24.960
I am extremely puffy.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.239
It's okay. I can cover it up.

00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:31.289
Pat it down. Pat it all down.

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:35.119
That's it. The puffiness is going down.

00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:36.920
Shall I do it?

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:39.199
I'm stronger than you. It'll help cover the puffiness.

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:41.960
Why did I eat with you last night?

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:44.959
My face can't get any puffier than this.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.360
You were going to look like a dried squid or a half-dried squid.

Goodness.

00:35:51.769 --> 00:35:53.768
- I can make it happen. - My Sosik. Did you sleep well?

00:35:53.769 --> 00:35:56.199
I will draw my dream with makeup.

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:59.719
I am not a squid.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.960
Oh, gosh. My puffy feet fit Soo Jin's designer shoes.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.599
How lucky.

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:28.718
Take me to a good place,

who is and is not like Cinderella,

is heading towards her fate.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.840
Both the ash-covered Cinderella and the penniless poor...

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.439
need to doll up when going outside...

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.639

I so envy Shin Ae.

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.719
To think she'd marry and leave this quickly.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.518
Is this the power of love?

00:37:24.519 --> 00:37:26.078
Do you think that's true love?

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:28.078
She did it after much calculation.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:31.118
You know, the mind doesn't control love.

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:33.118
It's the heart that does.

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.199
To be precise,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.639
it's the brain.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.440
At the most, it's the work of the useless sex hormones.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.199
Why are sex hormones useless?

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.920
When used well, sex hormones help a person grow.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.480
You want to become cooler,

00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:47.288
and you'll end up with a cooler child.

00:37:47.289 --> 00:37:48.599
I already have many children.

00:37:48.639 --> 00:37:50.960
What? I knew it.

00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:53.719
Since you're old money, are they out of wedlock?

00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.880
Here. Yahub.

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:04.039
Kwami.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.639
Quequ.

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:09.880
I'm already sponsoring many children.

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:12.808
Gosh. This side of you is a big surprise.

00:38:12.809 --> 00:38:15.399
I'm like the deep ocean water.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.718
I'm the most thoughtful and clean person.

00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:20.360
Aren't you doing it to reduce tax?

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.880
Distorting...

00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:28.289
the rich's goodwill like that hurts.

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:32.960
- Get out of my sight at once. - I will take my leave.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.119
I miss them.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.518
(Direction to Interview Room)

00:38:47.519 --> 00:38:49.159
(Room: Chungdam Heaven Club CEO Room)

00:38:58.039 --> 00:38:59.809
Good job on applying for it.

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:02.599
You need a daring lucky draw to succeed.

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:04.399
Something will happen as you throw...

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.769
glass shoes at men after joining Chungdam Heaven.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.400
Come on. Glass shoes, my foot.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.769
Did I already get my lucky draw?

00:39:56.809 --> 00:40:00.000
Dad! Are you finally helping me?

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.719
I'm suing you.

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:06.079
For what? Did I steal your heart?

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.809
Does he want my number?

00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:11.840
What do you mean by that?

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:16.239
For attempted murder.

00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:20.880
What attempted murder?

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:25.559
How upsetting.

00:40:25.679 --> 00:40:27.639
Darn it for goodness' sake.

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:31.159
Let's watch what will happen to these two together.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.480
I'll see you next time.

00:40:33.769 --> 00:40:36.400
Bye, kidults!
