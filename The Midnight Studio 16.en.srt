I'm the one who should be angry. Why are you protesting?

327
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,740
I still can't let you go.

328
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
You aren't leaving, Seo Ki Joo.

329
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,770
I'm scared, too.

330
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,040
I don't want to die, either.

331
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,850
Then, just don't go.

332
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,700
But...

333
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,370
what's scarier than the path to the netherworld is...

334
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,670
living alone in a world where...

335
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,670
you aren't around.

336
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,720
So...

337
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,400
you should surrender just once.

338
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,300
I promise I'll be back.

339
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,270

Y-You don't know how scary it is since you've never been there.

341
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,110
There are no days, nights, seasons, or time there.

342
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,500
You should keep guard here.

343
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,140
Bom is alive because of the camera right now.

344
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,460
If I leave with the camera, she'll be in a defenseless state.

345
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,760
And on the day the black moon appears, ghosts get strong.

346
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,750
There will be evil spirits everywhere.

347
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,650
Please protect Bom just until...

348
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,100
I return the camera.

349
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,770

Will you go even if I don't give you the camera?

353

Yes.

354

You'll go even if I threaten not to see you again, right?

355

Yes.

356

Even if I said I don't want you to,

357

[Survival Kit]

370
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,340
It's a survival kit that lasts for at least three days during an earthquake.

371
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,680
There's a lighter and a heat pack.

Everything you need is in there.

373
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,440
It's not like a war broke out.

374
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,030
You're going somewhere scarier than the battlefield.

375
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,360
Make sure not to leave the studio tomorrow.

376
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,580
It'll be even more dangerous since the black moon will appear.

377
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm sorry...

378

for putting you in danger again.

379
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,990
I won't be soppy and spend Christmas alone.

380
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,390
I'll go on a blind date first if you don't come back.

381
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,700
I'd be too worried to leave.

382
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,900
So, come back quickly. Otherwise, I'll misbehave.

383
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,000
I promise I'll be back before sunrise.

384
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Are you sure you can go alone?

385

Please take good care of Bom.

No.

Ji Won, do you want to stay with another friend?

401
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,970
Yes, Ji Won. Stay somewhere else until tomorrow.

Yes, it's because of the camera.
