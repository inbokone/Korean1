Come on. I'm not unemployed.

187
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,980
I'm just taking a break.

188
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,420
That's what unemployed means.

189

I'm looking into how to send you back.

190
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,910
I'll send you off somehow.

191
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,040
Mr. Seo,

192
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
I don't want to leave.

193
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,400
You won't?

194
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,530
- If you stay in this world for too long-
- I know.

195
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,240
I might get destroyed by an evil spirit,

196
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,160
and I can become an evil spirit, too.

197
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,380
But maybe I won't.

198
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,530
I've only been living according to plans when I was alive.

199
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,860
You can become unemployed if you don't get a job

200
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,200
and you can grow old alone if you don't get married.

201
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,390
I was afraid of things like that.

202
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,250
I thought veering off the path would be a disaster.

203
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,990
But the worst thing that could happen to me

204
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,200
is not being able to see someone I love.

205
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,390
Even if I become an evil spirit tomorrow,

206
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,860
I want to hang out with Ji Won today.

207
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,760
But you shouldn't think of it so lightly.

208
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,600
No one knows what happens to a ghost who stayed here too long.

209
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,210
I'll take that risk, too.

210
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,660
Because my time belongs to me.

211
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,910
You can just keep assisting me, then.

212
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,900
Mr. Seo,

213
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,270
will you raise my salary, then?

214
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,930
- What?
- Pardon?

215
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,460
I provide food and lodging.

216
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,440
Burn more clothes each quarter, then.

217
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,840
How much did you spend on clothes at Galleria last time?

218
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,350
I only did that once!

219
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,590
You spend five million. Five million.

220
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,660
- It was 4.9 million!
- That's five million!

221
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,810
What?

222
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,650
He'll generously extend my contract?

223

Gosh, Chief Kim, that son of a bitch...

224

Chief Kim really went too far this time.

She never got to go home on time.

240
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,920
By the way, Ji Won,

241
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,640
did something happen today?

242
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,760
You seem a bit upset.

243
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm curious about something.

244
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,250
You scared off all the interns who worked here,

245
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,160
but why didn't you ever punish Chief Kim?

246
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,080
You must've resented him a lot.

247
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,260
I would've killed him already if I were a ghost.

248
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,650
Maybe I should actually kill him.

249
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,280
The day I died,

250
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,340
Chief Kim was the last person I talked to on the phone.

251
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,680
He was screaming at me.

252
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,650
And I suddenly couldn't breathe.

253

The sky looked yellow, too.

254

Whenever I think of that,

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,660
it gets hard to breathe.

259

There are too many.

263

Since the studio's door was sealed,

264
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,920
I might not be able to go back, apparently.

265
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,110
I might become an evil spirit and disappear.

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,360
How could the eldest and second eldest get the same amount?

333
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,050
The eldest son takes care of his memorial services.

334
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,420
He should get a little more.

335
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,780
He said he needs 300 million won.

336
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,570
Defendant, do you have an IOU, by chance?

337
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,740
I-I don't.

338
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,720
A parent and a child don't need an IOU. You just go without it.

339
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
He's lying.

340
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,520
He owes over 100 million to a private loan company.

341
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,060
How could he have lent money to Father?

342
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,350
- That's what the eldest son says!
- Plaintiff, please be quiet.

343
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,530
Be quiet, please.

344
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,600
No, I'm sorry.

345
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,240
Lady, I asked you to get my money back.

346
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
That money is so important.

347
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,830
Ssada Market. Just go to Ssada Market and look for Park Bok Rye.

348
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,440
You've been ignoring me since yesterday.

349
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,020
Lady, I know you see me.

350
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,010
Excuse me.

351
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,950
B-But Plaintiff was the one who's been helping his father.

352
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,440
He's been paying his father a million won every month for living expenses.

353
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,820
I'll submit the bank transfer record as evidence.

354
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,130
How can you be like this?

355
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,800
You need to at least look if an elder is talking to you.

356
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,700
Don't be rude!

357
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,630
Attorney Han, what are you doing?

358
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,230
Attorney.

359
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,270
Lady, can you hear me now?

361
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,700
Stop, I'm begging you!

362
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,380
- Attorney.
- You're not letting me work. You aren't.

363
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,660
I'll ask the plaintiff's defense to leave the court.

364
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,040
The backup attorney can continue.

365
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,900
Oh, o-okay.

366
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,580
Why are you doing this to me?

367
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,230
My client could've suffered damage because of you.

368
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,250
I'm suffering damage because of you.

369
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,110
What did I do, exactly?

370
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,810
You're not doing what you're supposed to do.

371
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,590
You need to open the door for me!

372
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,620
What door do you mean?

373
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,270
Gosh, I don't know. I don't know what you mean.

374
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,380
Stop following me.

375
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,300
Hey! Stop right there!

376
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,610
So, he extended your contract and...

377
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,470
he hired his daughter?

378
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,940
Yes! Chief Kim, that son of a bitch.

379
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,810
I've been working to the bone all this time.

380
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,840
By the way, do you know what's funny?

381
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,750
- What?
- After all that,

382
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,770
I worked overtime tonight.

383
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,030
Why? Because I had to keep the extended contract.

384
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,920
What? Hey, that's considered exploitation.

385
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,030
That's my specialty. Do you want me to sue him?

386
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,300
No.

387
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,160
Chief Kim might be incapable and annoying,

388
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,490
but I can't get a new job if I make a bad impression.

389
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,410
And no one hires me because I'm a cancer patient.

390
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,680
Hey. Stop drinking.

391
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,630
You're a cancer patient. Don't drink.

392
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,120
I used to be a cancer patient.

393
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,430
You're just a patient.

394
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,140
By the way, what's going on with you?

395
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,730
Ghosts. Ghosts keep following me.

396
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,900
I thought that curse or whatever was lifted.

397
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,850
That's what I'm saying.

398
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,340
It's weird.

399
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,400
Ask the photographer.

400
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,870
No.

401
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,540
Ever since Mr. Baek left,

402
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,910
he's been blaming himself a lot already.

403
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,800
I can't add to his worries.

404
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,220
You date someone who sees ghosts

405
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,390
and I date a ghost.

406
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,240
- Ji Won.
- Yes?

407
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,990
Are you okay, by the way?

408
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,920
About what?

409
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,350
About Deputy Go.

410
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,670
He's really nice and great.

411
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,590
But Ji Won,

412
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,040
he's a dead person.

413
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,620
I...

414
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,770
like him.

415
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,000
I like him a lot.

416
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,660
[Pharmacy]

417
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,340
How does she still have a cold?

418
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,100
She got so thin.

419
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,570
I should get her herbal medicine or something.

420
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,410
You...

421
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,690
Why is she sleeping in this cold room?

422
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,390
Hey, Kim Ji Won, get up.

423
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,030
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.

424
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,060
- Geez.
- It's cold. Come.

425
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,910
Hey, I'll kill Chief Kim. I will.

426
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,570
Okay, okay.

427
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,300
Hey, Ji Won!

428
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,380
Ji Won.

429
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,120
What's going on?

430
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,690
What's this?

431
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,640
You're the angel of death, aren't you?

432
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,400
You've been...

433
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,020
cursing my family for a hundred years.

434
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,620
Human, there was no curse.

435
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:28,600
It's just that your ancestor had a desperate wish.

436
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,640
Please let my child live.

437
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,840
Allow him to live until

438
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,600
he reaches my age, 35.

439
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,270
I beg you.

440
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,690
Then, his child and

441
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,820
his descendants will all end up with the same fate.

442
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,130
Do you still want that?

443
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,120
Your ancestor made the decision.

444
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,520
All I did was give him an opportunity.

445
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,890
You didn't give him an opportunity.

446
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,300
You just enjoyed watching us desperately trying to survive.

447
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:10,490
You're the ones who dared to desire what belongs in the netherworld.

448
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,930
Did you think you wouldn't pay for it at all?

449
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,460
Why did you let me live?

450
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,220
For what reason?

451
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,280
Because I need to receive something from you.

452
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
- What do you mean-
- You prayed, too.

453
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,000
Just like Seo Nam Gook. Desperately.

454
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,640
Pray?

455
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,660
By chance... By chance, is the price...

456
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,890
As long as the camera stays in this world,

457
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,830
someone has to carry on the task.

458
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,200
The one you tried to save desperately will be

459
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,860
paying the price now.

460
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,170
No way...

461
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,440
There's no way!

462
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,300
Please...

463
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,790
Please, not Bom.

464
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,720
It can't be Bom...

465
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,350
Please... Please...

466
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,950
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...

467
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,480
Please.

468
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,350
Why is this...

469
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,120
Bom!

470
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,750
Bom!

471
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,370
Bom!

472
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,180
Bom.

473
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,890
No, don't touch it.

474
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,630
Mr. Seo.

475
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,100
Are you okay?

476
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,550
Are you hurt at all?

477
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,340
What's going on right now?

478
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,620
Why... Why is this on you?

479
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,930
S-Since when?

480
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,520
When Mr. Baek passed away.

481
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,540
By the way, Mr. Seo,

482
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,360
am I dying now?

483
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,930
Why is this...

484
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,520
Why is this on you, of all people?

485
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,240
Why you...

486
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,160
I thought it was all over.

487
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,390
How come you...

488
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,730
Mr. Seo.

489
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,730
You know better than anyone that this won't do anything.

490
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,270
This is your room.

491
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,410
The ghosts will be coming in here all the time.

492
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,870
That's great, then.

493
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,250
I should move into your house.

494
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,420
How could you joke around right now?

495
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,100
Yes, let's joke around.

496
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,420
Let's joke around and be silly.

497
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,300
And go on dates, too.

498
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,350

659
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,110
Ms. Park came to me.

660
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,890
- Ms. Park did?
- Yes.

661
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,790
- The dead person?
- Yes.

662
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,010
You're not making any sense right now.

663
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,120
This is driving me crazy.

664
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,690
Mr. Seo.

665
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,690
I'm sorry, Attorney Han.

666
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,270
It's my fault.

667
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,140
Not at all. I am actually grateful.

668
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,270
I could've been in trouble.

669
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,040
This reminds me of the old days. Don't you agree?

670
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,630
We met at a police station.

671
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,110
How could you joke around right now?

672
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,390
You should've called me, at least.

673
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,330
I'm sorry.

674
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,580
I didn't want you to worry.

675
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,160
Are you feeling okay?

676
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,980
Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Seo.

677
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,020
Sunbae.

678
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,480
Did you forget you had a trial today?

679
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,080
Well, I didn't forget-

680
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,510
You were supposed to bring the key evidence.

681
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,880
I called you dozens of times...

682
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,320
Do you know how much trouble our client is in because of you?

683
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,850
Well, I'm sorry, Sunbae. But the thing is-

684
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,450
Attorney Han, I've been giving you a pass because

685
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:20,080
you at least cared about your clients.

686
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:48,850
Uncle, please tell me.

687
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,260
What did you find out, exactly?

688
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,170
Going to that tunnel won't tell you anything.

689
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,970
Look at this.

690
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,480
One of them is the date my uncle went missing.

691
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,660
The other dates are when the Black Moon appeared.

692
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,520
My uncle found out how to go to the netherworld. To meet the angel of death.

693
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,290
But going there won't tell you anything.

694
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,620
There's a temple that's over a hundred years old in Mt. Yongmoon near there.

695
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,420
I'll try to find out something there.

696
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,600
Please take good care of Bom.

697
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,940
Don't worry, and get going.

698
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,360
Hey, Kim Ji Won!

699
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,720
1,000?

700
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,920
I told you to order 10,000. Where's the last zero?

701
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,660
Can't you get it together?

702
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,820
I didn't put in the order.

703
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,290
Hey, don't you see this?

704
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,320
You put in the order for this event!

705
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,550
There's no way.

706
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,030
Ye Na was supposed to put in the order-

707
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:18,680
I put in the order on your computer because mine is broken.

708
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,420
Ye Na did put in that order.

709
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,910
She used my computer because hers apparently broke.

710
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,830
Right?

711
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,920
Is that true, Ms. Kim?

712
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,260
No, you said you'd put in the order for me.

713
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,780
Why...

714
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,360
are you blaming me?

715
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,000
You did put in the order!

716
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,400
That's why your name is right here!

717
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,300
- How dare you blame the new employee?
- I said I didn't do it!

718
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,890
I'll make you compensate it if the event goes wrong!

719
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,650
You'd better get the full amount.

720
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,920
You'll have to pay for it if even one of them is missing!

721
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,280
No one better help her!

722
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,920
You do it all.

723
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,400
I'm sorry, sir. There was a mistake on our end.

724
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,980
I'll put in a new order, so-

725
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,100
I don't care. That's your problem.

726
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,210
We can't do that. Hang up. Hang up.

Hello, this is Onjeong Foods.

01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,700
Okay, got it.

Ji Won.

731
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,890
You said you like musicals, right?

732
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:56,040
I reserved the VIP seats for us.

733
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,570
Take tomorrow off. Let's go see it together.

734
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:01,550
Seong Ho, I'm an intern.

735
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,610
I can't take days off whenever

736
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,680
and I don't have a lot of free time right now.

737
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:13,350
Is it because of that cocky chief's daughter?

738
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:18,330
Don't worry, I punished her for you.

739
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:26,980
Was it you who broke her computer, by chance?

740
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,910
Yes. I took revenge on her for you.

741
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,300
You think I'm putting up with it because I'm a fool?

742
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,920
It's annoying me to death,

743
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,920
but I need to keep this position no matter what.

744
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,920
I'm hanging in with all my might.

745
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,790
W-What do you...

746
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,170
g-get from hanging in there like that?

747
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,790
I got rejected 20 times before I came here.

Including the places I never would've applied to before I got sick.

749
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,230
My bank account is draining...

750
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,630
and I don't have a place to live.

751
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:14,670
Will you give up on everything, then?

752
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,820
Including your health, happiness, and everything?

753
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,670
I'll get going now.

754
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,740

[Mt. Yongmoon]

756
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,300
People used to say...

757
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,710
this is the place closest to the netherworld.

758
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,550
The night when there's no light at all.

759
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:13,090
That's the only night the gate to the netherworld opens.

760
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,370
And the beings from the netherworld come out.

761
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,130
That place...

762
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,310
Please tell me where it is exactly.

763
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,420
It'd be better not to know.

764
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,110
Foolish people go there to make a wish on those nights

765
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,450
and always get into tragic accidents.

766
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,550
Also, because too many people died in the Jangjin Tunnel,

767
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,710
it was shut down 20 years ago.

768
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:38,350
We call it "The tunnel of death."

769
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,930
Someone asked the same question you asked 20 years ago.

770
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:47,430
He said he had to take back something he happened to acquire.

771
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,730
That was my uncle.

772

Please. Please tell me anything.

773
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:56,610
No one who went in there came back alive.

774
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,380
No living person can go to that place.

775
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:16,340
Do you still insist on going?

776
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,950
Yes.

777
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,230

822
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,530
Living like this.

823
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,510
Being harassed by ghosts every day

824
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,240
and people treating you like you're crazy.

825
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,410
Living in this world without being able to go far away somewhere.

826
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:06,440
That's how you used to live, too.

827
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:12,440
I shouldn't have been greedy then.

828
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:18,300
Safe zone or not, I shouldn't have been greedy

829
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,120
and just accepted my fate.

830
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,310
In order for me to live,

831
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:28,710
I dragged you in, Bom.

832
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,270
Don't be like that, Mr. Seo. I said I'm okay.

833
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,300
I'm not okay with it.

834
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,110
So...

835
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,410
I'm thinking of visiting the netherworld.

836
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,340
The netherworld?

837
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,920
I promise I'll be back.

838
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:53,170
Could you wait for me?

839
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:52,280
♫ Because I couldn't figure out what I could do for you ♫

840
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:58,540
♫ Because I felt bad for my feelings for you ♫

841
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:05,510
♫ I think of you being with me every waking moment ♫

842
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,340

843
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,870
The path to the netherworld?

844
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:13,360
You don't know how scary it is since you've never been there.

845
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,740
I said I'm okay.

846
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,670
How could I send you to the netherworld so I could live?

847
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,590
I promise I'll be back before sunrise.

848
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:27,150
Please protect Bom until I return the camera.

849
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,650
Where's Mr. Seo?

850
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:36,170
It's time to end everything.
