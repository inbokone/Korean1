LIAR LION

3
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,482
Liar Lion.

4
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:08,572
"Once upon a time, there lived a liar lion
in the faraway Lion Land."

5
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:14,620
"The lion had the most beautiful mane."

6
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,875
"All the other lions were jealous
of his magnificent mane."

7
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,794
It looks so cool.

8
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:27,466
"But the lion had a big secret."

9
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,592
What could it be?

10
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:31,386
"His mane was fake."

11
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,430
It was fake.

12
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:41,104
"The fake mane made him uncomfortable
and hurt his head,

13
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:45,442
but he put up with it
because he didn't want to take it off."

14
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:52,115
"The lion blamed his mom and dad
for not giving him a nice mane."

15
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,746
"'This is my mane.
I have the coolest mane in the world.'"

16
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:03,710
"But the lion was always afraid
that his secret might be revealed."

00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,425
EPISODE 12: FRANKLY SPEAKING

18
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:02,060
Mom.

19
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:04,605
Yu-jeong.

20
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,868
I thought you might not wake up.

21
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,330
I was terrified.

22
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,417
I had a good sleep.

23
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,418
Yeah.

24
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,962
I feel refreshed.

25
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes.

26
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,095
Why are you crying?

27
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,353
My In-su.

28
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:45,979
You're a crybaby, aren't you?

29
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,194
What's wrong?

30
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:53,779
Don't cry.

31
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:57,491
Why are you crying?

32
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,710
Don't cry, In-su.

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,963
You have three grown sons.

34
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,928
You're a crybaby.

35
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,685
Yeah.

36
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,620
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

37
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,698
Drink some water and have some food.

38
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:24,494
If your mother saw you drinking like this,
she would chew you out.

39
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,440
She said when she felt better...

40
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:58,653
she'd go to your salon
to get her hair done.

41
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:04,367
She said she picked out
the best ones she had.

42
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:08,330
This is so like her.

43
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,375
She just loved giving out things
in envelopes.

44
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,963
She kept asking

45
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:21,760
what if she never got a chance

46
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:25,055
to apologize to you.

47
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:29,351
If she wanted to,
she should've apologized.

48
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:31,770
She could've gotten her hair done

49
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,689
and thrown money in an envelope.

50
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,528
She should've come to see
the girl she hated one last time.

51
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,003
JEWELRY FOR BOK-JA

52
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,009
I've never seen Dad cry before.

53
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,555
I've never heard him call Mom by her name.

54
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,475
I've never seen him fight.

55
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,192
Come in. Your mom is asking for you.

56
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:24,156
Mom.

57
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:30,370
I saved the last episode
of Ppong-sik's Family to watch with you.

58
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,831
I would feel betrayed
if you had watched it.

59
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,583
Let me see you.

60
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,545
Goodness, why is your hair so disheveled?

61
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,840
You seem to have lost a lot of weight
because of me.

62
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:45,719
Are you all right?

63
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:47,262
Does it hurt anywhere?

64
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,056
I'm okay. Perfectly fine.

65
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:01,735
My dear boys.

66
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:03,737
Have you eaten?

67
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,009
Kim Jeong-heon.

68
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,303
Jeong-heon!

69
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,223
Cancel everything on my schedule.
I want to take a break.

70
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:34,684
You go MIA for days,
and now you want to do what?

71
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:37,395
Are you actually going to retire?

72
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,356
No.

73
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,441
What then?

74
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:42,943
Hibernate?

75
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:49,491
When I wake up in the spring,
I'll think about it.

76
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:51,910
What are you, a frog?

77
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,204
No, a raccoon.

78
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:57,582
Seriously though.

79
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,753
In the past few years,
I've never even taken a week off.

80
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,588
Not even a full day, actually.

81
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,340
You know that better than anyone.

82
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:15,767
Ms. Ma.

83
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,105
I know I'm making things hard for you.

84
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,690
Then why are you doing this?

85
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,483
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

86
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,988
So cut me some slack, Mi-ra.

87
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:34,953
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

88
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:36,580
Oh, hey!

89
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,082
- Hey, how are you?
- Great, thanks.

90
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,584
How's your show going?

91
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,127
Okay, I guess.

92
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,338
By the way, is Min-gu working with you?

93
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:46,965
Yeah, why?

94
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,759
Well, my assistant called it quits,
so I called him,

95
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,344
but he said he wasn't available.

96
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:53,722
We're planning a show together.

97
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:55,015
I see.

98
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:59,853
Listen. I hear Min-gu works
as a chauffeur on the side now.

99
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:01,730
What?

100
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,690
I'm sorry to ask you this,

101
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,859
but if you're still in the planning stage,

102
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:09,279
could he join our team for a few months
with additional pay?

103
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,573
When your show gets slotted,
I'll send him back.

104
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:17,912
Wow, cool.

105
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,249
- Let me see what else it can do.
- This is amazing.

106
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,001
- It's so pretty.
- Hi, Woo-ju.

107
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,461
Oh, hello.

108
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:25,962
Hey.

109
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,174
Oh, you got coffee. Thank you.

110
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,842
Thank you.

111
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:33,345
Woo-ju, check this out.

112
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:35,263
- This would be good for games.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:36,765
You should try it too.

114
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,488
OUR CAPTAIN

115
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,115
Our captain.

116
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:02,165
Want me to remove it?

117
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,083
No.

118
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,168
It's cool.

119
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,589
I-na. Let's get to work.

120
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,632
Okay.

121
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:15,929
You guys are fired.

122
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,056
What?

123
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,975
I broke the only rule of our team.

124
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,352
Therefore, we're disbanding.

125
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,063
What's the rule of our team?

126
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:27,482
Min-gu, you tell her.

127
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,777
We don't work for unfair wages.

128
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,114
But that's just until production starts.

129
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:35,865
I heard you have a part-time job.

130
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,828
And I-na's probably
in a similar situation.

131
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:44,332
You two must be getting lots of offers,
but you don't want me to feel bad.

132
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,292
It's not like that, Woo-ju.

133
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:55,468
Go eat and then go home.
Don't come back here.

134
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:10,483
I'm really glad to hear about your mother.

135
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,901
Thank you.

136
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:15,655
You must be feeling better.
Can you focus on work now?

137
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,282
Yes.

138
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,868
Ki-baek.

139
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:23,913
I don't need to tell you
how important this time is for you, right?

140
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,635
I LOVE NEWS!

141
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,182
You asked me before if you could do
news shows as a freelancer.

142
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,978
Right. I did.

143
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:51,691
Do you still want to host news shows?

144
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,739
I'm surprised
Ms. Ma is letting you do news shows.

145
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:00,867
It's not an authentic news show.
It's a casual thing.

146
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,578
Still, the format is the same, isn't it?

147
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:08,708
What's wrong?
You were dying to do a news show.

148
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,627
Yeah, I was.

149
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,629
I thought it'd kill me
if I couldn't do it.

150
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,339
No, it won't kill you.

151
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,298
It won't.

152
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,426
Are you embarrassed?

153
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:23,097
Because it feels like you're sniffing
around it again after kicking it away?

154
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:26,226
Tell me. Why are you hesitating?

155
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:30,063
I'm not. I already gave her my answer.

156
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,565
So you told her you'd do it?

157
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,402
I don't want to do a news show.

158
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,699
I'm not going to.

159
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:48,456
I actually did some research on you.
But this is unexpected.

160
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:55,755
I'm not the same person I used to be.

161
00:13:57,632 --> 00:14:00,510
A lot has happened
since you quit your last job, right?

162
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:03,930
Yes. So many things have happened.

163
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,810
Still, I'm curious
because you sound so certain.

164
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,899
I thought it'd make me look successful.

165
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,694
I thought being seated
at the heart of the news desk

166
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:22,365
would prove that I was a successful man.

167
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:27,161
That's why you were obsessed with it?
Like it'd kill you if you didn't do it?

168
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:32,417
Whenever people talked me up
and said I had it all,

169
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,127
you have no idea how anxious I was.

170
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,838
The truth is, I've got nothing.

171
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:41,426
I've lived my whole life
hiding behind a flashy mask.

172
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:46,389
Look, everyone wears a mask. Who doesn't?

173
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,267
Unless you get struck by lightning
and lose your mind.

174
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:54,272
Luckily, I was struck by lightning
straight through.

175
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,774
What?

176
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:59,235
I thought I was going to go down for sure,

177
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,529
but I didn't.

178
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,783
It actually made me happy and smile more.

179
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:09,913
I thought,
Man, have I really gone insane?

180
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,044
Still, hosting a news show
was your dream.

181
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,212
It was my dream.

182
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:19,881
Actually,

183
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:22,884
it still is.

184
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:30,850
My real dream is to report
the truth to the world and be honest.

185
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,853
That's what makes me happy.
I've realized that now.

186
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,897
Then why did you turn it down?

187
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:14,769
You're home.

188
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:15,853
Yeah.

189
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,694
Is Yeong-won okay?

190
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:25,613
Of course not.

191
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,616
He's your boyfriend.
Shouldn't you be with him?

192
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:34,330
A middle-aged man's girlfriend
staying at his mother's funeral all day?

193
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,207
It could make some people gossip.

194
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,960
Why would you worry about that?

195
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,336
I don't.

196
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:43,673
My makeup got smudged.
I'm going to fix myself up and go back.

197
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:51,305
Does Yeong-won...

198
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,600
talk to you about getting married?

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,187
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

200
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:00,648
Did you have dinner?

201
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,900
I just grabbed something small.

202
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:13,703
What?

203
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:17,331
- Why do you have fried chicken?
- You said you didn't eat.

204
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,709
How sweet of you.

205
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:30,094
I didn't have an appetite, but the chicken
my boyfriend got me sure tastes good.

206
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,639
What made you lose...

207
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,518
What's the matter, Woo-ju?

208
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,480
Do you want to get married?

209
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:44,567
What? Wait... If we...

210
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,904
What comes to your mind
when you hear that?

211
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:52,700
I think about how much I love you,
and I feel some sense of responsibility.

212
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,578
I feel like we'd be able to get through
anything together--

213
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:56,788
My mom.

214
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:01,751
That my mom would have to live
by herself without me.

215
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:07,215
I'm sure my mom would
think about me first too.

216
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,258
Is your mother

217
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:11,886
getting married?

218
00:18:13,638 --> 00:18:16,933
What? Does she think
I'm going to stop her if she wants to?

219
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:18,935
She's so old-fashioned.

220
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:29,028
My mom and I are a little different
from other moms and daughters.

221
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:32,824
We saved each other's lives.

222
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:39,372
We wouldn't have survived
if we didn't have each other.

223
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,418
You appear to be
an ordinary mom and daughter duo.

224
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:50,967
I don't know
what my mom wants to do exactly.

225
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:11,779
You said you shouldn't hide anything
from the person you love.

226
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,072
That you shouldn't have to.

227
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,701
Try being honest with her first.

228
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:21,164
Thanks to someone, I tried that,
and it's not that difficult.

229
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:37,430
- Are you going back to work soon?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

230
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,432
Gu-won, you must be sad.

231
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:43,561
Nope. You have no idea how much she nags.

232
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:47,565
Mom, I want you to work. Really.

233
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,527
You wouldn't leave my side at home.

234
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,280
That's because
I thought you might be bored.

235
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,990
You hurt my feelings.

236
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,575
Give me my phone. Use yours.

237
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:00,745
But mine is for kids, and it's no fun.

238
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,915
Mom, will you buy me a new phone? Please?

239
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:06,083
You are a kid.

240
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,835
Oh, Mom.

241
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,421
I won't play with you anymore then.

242
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:12,256
Hang out with your friends instead.

243
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:15,092
I have no friends.
I'm going to hang out with you.

244
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:17,720
You bug me.

245
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,932
Give me back my phone!

246
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,642
Don't go through stuff.

247
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,728
Stay for lunch. I made dumplings.

248
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:26,729
Okay.

249
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,201
CAPTAIN YEON

250
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,204
Hello.

251
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:51,921
WANT TO HANG OUT?
MADAME ON

252
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,756
What? Gu-won...

253
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,091
God.

254
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,761
I'm sorry. Gu-won pulled a prank.

255
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,846
Oh, I see.

256
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,436
Well, then I should go.

257
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,440
- You need a haircut.
- Sorry?

258
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,441
Have a seat.

259
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:14,902
Goodness.

260
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:21,701
It's dangerous if you move,
so stay put, okay?

261
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,704
We'll go have some dumplings.

262
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,128
I got some nice new machines,

263
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:34,547
but you haven't been coming to the gym.

264
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:38,759
Because you always
make me do difficult stuff.

265
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,262
Well, Yeon.

266
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,889
You just don't have muscles.

267
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:46,225
You're all skin and bones.

268
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:49,228
But, Un-baek,

269
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:52,398
you said I was cute.

270
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,357
Oh, you are...

271
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,485
still cute, of course.

272
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,240
Then, when we're done here...

273
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,912
do you want to hang out?

274
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:12,543
Sure. I'd love to.

275
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:46,202
Are you busy?

276
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:48,537
Yeah.

277
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm busy too.

278
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,917
So what?

279
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,255
How about a drink?

280
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,924
No.

281
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:01,801
Are you upset?

282
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:03,761
Yeah.

283
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,681
LET'S HAVE SOME KAOLIANG LIQUOR

284
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:27,618
Oh, for God's sake!

285
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,036
It's just your bad luck.

286
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:37,920
Mom.

287
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:39,547
Yeah?

288
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:42,299
If Yeong-won wants to get married,

289
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,425
you should.

290
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:46,679
I know you like him a lot.

291
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:51,433
What's with all this marriage talk
all of a sudden?

292
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,104
I'm too old to get married now.
It's gross.

293
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:58,440
You didn't get to do anything in
your twenties and thirties because of me.

294
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,609
You should date and get married.

295
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,653
Do whatever you want to do.

296
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:05,364
There's nothing I want to do. I'm done.

297
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:07,992
I'm happy with my life now.

298
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:10,327
Nothing to complain about.

299
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:17,668
Why are you always happy with everything?

300
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:18,752
Listen to you.

301
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:22,173
You're on another level of crazy today.

302
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:25,259
Everything you've done
is to make things easier for me.

303
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,678
There's nothing you want to do?
That can't be true.

304
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,430
Why would you lie?

305
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:34,435
Do you think I wasn't prepared to do that
when I took you in?

306
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,897
You saved my life,
so I knew I had to give you a better one.

307
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:41,317
I thought making you happy
would make me feel like

308
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:44,570
I'd done at least
one good thing in my life.

309
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,613
Satisfied?

310
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:51,660
That's exactly why I can't do anything
but smile in front of you.

311
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:56,498
Because I feel like I can't be unhappy.

312
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:58,626
What?

313
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,380
What's the matter with you?

314
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,841
You weren't even like this as a teenager.

315
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:08,552
I should've just
told you everything back then.

316
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:11,222
You and I were both being foolish.

317
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,848
So what? Are you going to run away?

318
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,684
Mom, I'm being serious here.
Why would you say that?

319
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:18,771
What should I say then?
"I'm sorry I lived my life that way"?

320
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,648
"I didn't realize how you felt"?

321
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:22,566
That's not what I'm saying.

322
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,907
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

323
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:45,297
Hey.

324
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:54,974
Things look different...

325
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,227
You got rid of most of the liquor.

326
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:05,985
All the locks are gone.

327
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,695
Good for you.

328
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:10,739
Let's drink.

329
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,116
Here?

330
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:14,118
Where else?

331
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:20,916
Can I go in there?

332
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,673
Wow, so you've got
absolutely nothing in here.

333
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,592
Did you think there'd be a safe
or something?

334
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:33,470
Having nothing.

335
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:36,432
That's the biggest secret indeed.

336
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:43,939
Should I start up a business?

337
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:45,316
What?

338
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:48,444
"Fried chicken
made by your ideal son-in-law." No.

339
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,324
"Noodles made by your ideal son-in-law."
Don't you think that might work?

340
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:58,162
But perhaps,
no one would call me that now.

341
00:26:58,162 --> 00:26:59,913
You're being ridiculous.

342
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:03,334
I've watched my dad's businesses fail
my whole life.

343
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,044
It's not for everybody.

344
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:07,629
Then what should I do with my life now?

345
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,677
Do you know what the funny part is?

346
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:17,306
I was the one who walked away
from everything,

347
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,975
but I still found myself
watching my shows.

348
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,896
It's absurd, isn't it? Why do I care?

349
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:26,815
Because you like your job.

350
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:31,820
I got panic disorder doing what I like.
Who would understand that?

351
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:34,031
So what if no one does?

352
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:37,159
Would that make you not like it anymore
or make your problems go away?

353
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,663
Stop thinking about others
and get better first.

354
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:46,210
After that, you can sell fried chicken
or noodles or whatever.

355
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,212
I'm going to make a comeback.

356
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,132
When I'm all better,

357
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,635
I'm going to do what I like again.

358
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:58,555
If you've already made your decision,
why did you even ask?

359
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:01,642
I just wanted to whine about it
to a friend, okay?

360
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:11,944
If I do what I like
and fall flat on my face,

361
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,531
can I come and whine about it too?

362
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,282
I like it here.

363
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:30,003
MY WOO-JU

364
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:31,422
I ran away from home.

365
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,800
I've got to go deal with
a runaway delinquent.

366
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,595
Huh? Do you patrol your neighborhood now
or something?

367
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:40,639
It's a special operation.

368
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:57,823
You scared me.

369
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,825
Drinking alcohol
and running away from home?

370
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:00,993
I should arrest you.

371
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,828
Have you been drinking too?

372
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:05,748
Yeah. A little.

373
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,417
That's good.

374
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,962
It would've been embarrassing
if you were sober.

375
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:18,051
Why did my delinquent adult Ms. On Woo-ju
run away from home so late at night?

376
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,096
I had a fight with my mom.

377
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:25,017
You did? Tell me what happened.

378
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,812
Well, it wasn't exactly a fight.

379
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:32,024
I just got upset
and took it out on her, I guess.

380
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:37,070
I've never lashed out at her before,

381
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:42,075
but guess what? It felt really good.

382
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:45,204
It's all so embarrassing.

383
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,539
How do I go home and face her? Man.

384
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,252
Here's how.

385
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:56,173
You'll play on the swing while drunk,
hang out with your boyfriend for a while,

386
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,716
and then go home.

387
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:58,675
Yeah?

388
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:07,810
I know you're feeling down,
but can I tell you some good news?

389
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,728
Oh, yeah. What is it?

390
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:15,317
I'm going to give it a try.

391
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:20,113
My dream that I haven't given up.

392
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:21,740
I think I can do it now.

393
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:26,995
Thanks to somebody,
now I have the courage to try.

394
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:31,041
I hope your dream comes true, Ki-baek.

395
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,544
Wish me luck.

396
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:35,295
Good luck.

397
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,177
- Can you push a little harder?
- All right.

398
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,345
Harder?

399
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,264
Hold on tight.

400
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:50,060
What do you mean?

401
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,108
Father is quite angry.

402
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,112
God, I'm hungry.

403
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:01,697
I'm starving.

404
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:04,867
Are you all right?
You should come with me.

405
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:09,454
You mean girl. You get me all upset
and crawl in at this hour?

406
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,331
Well...

407
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:12,457
That's right.

408
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,919
Raising you, I kept myself from

409
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,006
doing what I wanted
to give you your best chance. So what?

410
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:23,093
Well, I'm just saying
you shouldn't do that anymore.

411
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:27,639
I chose to do that, just like how
I'm choosing to live my life this way now.

412
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,850
Who are you to tell me to date
or get married?

413
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:33,270
- You're lying.
- Did you say I'm lying?

414
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,813
- Lying?
- Ouch.

415
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:37,274
I thought you were finally growing up.

416
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:39,109
Why are you acting like a teenager?

417
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:45,991
I just want you to do all the things
you want to do from now on.

418
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,077
Look at that.

419
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,291
He hasn't even mentioned marriage.

420
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,710
- So who am I supposed to marry?
- What?

421
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,337
Myself?

422
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,297
He hasn't proposed?

423
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:02,215
No.

424
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:03,508
No way!

425
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:07,054
What?

426
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:12,100
It's heavy. Take it easy.

427
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,356
- I'm off.
- Jeong-heon, wait.

428
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:19,441
Are you sure you'll be okay?

429
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:21,026
Why wouldn't I be?

430
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,488
Tomorrow, your panic disorder and hiatus
will be all over the news.

431
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:27,824
That was my idea.

432
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:30,702
Exactly. I'm asking
if you're really okay with that.

433
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,080
Take good care of my fan club.

434
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,206
I'll see you.

435
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:37,250
When will you be back?
You bought a one-way ticket.

436
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,293
I don't know.

437
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:39,920
Jeong-heon!

438
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:45,008
I'll miss you.

439
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:47,928
- You're being gross.
- I am.

440
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:52,057
Bye.

441
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,686
Take care of yourself!

442
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:10,659
I HAVE THE BEST DAD

443
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:12,744
Let's get started.

444
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:13,662
Okay.

445
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,543
Hello, everyone.

446
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:24,381
Welcome to EHGS, Eat Healthy, Get Strong.

447
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,966
I'm Yoon Ji-hu.

448
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,016
I'll dig right in.

449
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:37,853
Boy, this looks delicious.

450
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,367
Here's an egg.

451
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:55,120
A tomato.

452
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,131
COUPLE'S PARADISE
THE FIRST LOVE

453
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,174
Oh, right.

454
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:10,177
Yes. I see.

455
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,137
Right.

456
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:17,601
All right, Chief.

457
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:19,978
I understand. Bye.

458
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:28,737
Oh, my God!

459
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,201
Wait a minute.

460
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:39,414
This is too embarrassing.

461
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:42,751
COUPLE'S PARADISE 2
LOOKING FOR NEWCOMERS

462
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,928
You guys are being silly,
and it's killing me.

463
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:55,347
Come on, let me call Woo-ju.

464
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:58,517
- Don't.
- What do you want to do then?

465
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:02,145
Let's just wait. Woo-ju is not an idiot.

466
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,107
It's like you don't know her at all.

467
00:35:05,107 --> 00:35:07,400
She's been like that for over a decade.

468
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:09,778
People don't change so easily.

469
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:16,159
What?

470
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,703
Yeon. Ha-young.

471
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,165
I need your help.

472
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:27,671
Laundry Therapy. I really want to do this,
but I've got nothing.

473
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:30,173
I acted all tough
in front of Min-gu and I-na.

474
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:32,968
I sent them home
when they offered to help.

475
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:37,597
But I have to do this.
I really think I can.

476
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,724
The chief came by earlier.

477
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,519
- What?
- She told you to get things started.

478
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,437
You heard?

479
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:48,733
I've been waiting for you to come
and beg for my help.

480
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:50,902
Would that be okay?

481
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:53,446
I mean, you're the head writer
of Couple's Paradise.

482
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:55,699
I already passed it on
to Kim So-jeong's team.

483
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:56,950
What?

484
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,327
You didn't come to us

485
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,538
even when you were about to drown.

486
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:03,665
We were mad at you for that,
so we waited.

487
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,458
You quit the show too?

488
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,377
That's right, I did.

489
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:09,004
Guys.

490
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,384
Hi, I'm here for a job interview.

491
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,722
Min-gu. I-na.

492
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,350
I'm sorry.

493
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:24,978
I shouldn't have done that.

494
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,189
- We're family.
- Get a hold of yourselves.

495
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:28,648
This is the beginning.

496
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:32,777
If we don't get better ratings than
Couple's Paradise, our lives will be hell.

497
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:35,363
Doing laundry is not my thing though.

498
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:37,741
I even dry-clean my cotton T-shirts.

499
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:39,159
What?

500
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,745
How about Dry-Clean Therapy instead?

501
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,663
Sure. Anything you say.

502
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:46,499
I'll wash that foul mouth of yours too.

503
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,669
I'm meeting with Sinsang Electronics
tomorrow.

504
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:50,879
Okay.

505
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,090
- We'll need two mobile laundry trucks.
- That's right.

506
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,551
I-na and Min-gu,
draw up a list for casting.

507
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,595
- All right.
- All right, got it.

508
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:01,932
I promise I'll do a really good job.

509
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:03,600
Obviously.

510
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
Everyone on our team is good at their job.

511
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:07,020
Sparta!

512
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:17,020
- Woot, woot!
- Woot, woot!

513
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:24,829
Thank you.

514
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:37,467
This is for the website and PR material.

515
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,969
All right, let's start.

516
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,638
One, two, three.

517
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:45,350
Let's try a different pose.

518
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:47,018
Nice.

519
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,521
All right. Yeah, that's good.

520
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:59,114
FREELANCE ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK
RETURNS TO THE NEWS?!

521
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,326
6 MONTHS LATER

522
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,036
Sparkle, I see no one but you

523
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:08,707
Hop, hop, my adorable lady

524
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:12,085
Come to me, softly and quietly

525
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:15,755
Shyly profess your love to me
And run away

526
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:18,258
That's where the wolves live

527
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:19,718
Here we go!

528
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,303
Scary!

529
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:24,597
Make way, all of you, here I come

530
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:27,559
The raccoon that keeps his bunny safe

531
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,104
I'm your forever

532
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:34,107
Soul mate

533
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:39,487
All right. Clap!

534
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:40,739
Now cheer!

535
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:47,078
You know we're Yu-jeong's VIP clients,
don't you?

536
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:48,413
Oh, yes. Thank you.

537
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:52,000
While you're here,
take some pictures and sing with us.

538
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,585
Sure, of course.

539
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:55,545
Let me know if there's a product you need.

540
00:38:56,504 --> 00:39:00,925
All right. Let's sell these out today!

541
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:03,928
Can I take a picture with you?

542
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,641
He looks good in pictures too!

543
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,187
Go on. All right, take pictures.

544
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:14,898
Goodness, you're going to tire him out.

545
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,734
Make it quick, people. My son is busy.

546
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,820
He's got to go
to his news show, okay? Hurry.

547
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:25,033
I've got to hurry.

548
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:26,576
Got to go.

549
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:28,244
- Going out?
- Yes, to the airport.

550
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:29,621
Are you going on a trip?

551
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,248
I told you so many times.
I'm picking someone up.

552
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:33,333
Oh, right.

553
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:35,794
New blouse?

554
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:38,213
Yes, it is. Nice, isn't it?

555
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:39,714
It's nice.

556
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:43,676
I think he's going to propose.

557
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,054
What?

558
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,223
Oh, come on.

559
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:51,059
Save yourself the trouble of getting
disappointed and threatening him.

560
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,352
Just settle down.

561
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:55,438
We're going to Jeju Island.
The blue night of Jeju Island.

562
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:56,981
I can feel it.

563
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,317
If he acts lukewarm again--

564
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:00,985
You could propose to him.

565
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,448
That's why I got this.

566
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,035
I'm going to propose to him.

567
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:09,994
What?

568
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,373
Good luck.

569
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:14,666
- I'm off.
- Bye.

570
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,386
I heard something really funny today.

571
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:28,596
With your superpower?

572
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:30,765
- Yes.
- What is it?

573
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,187
No, really?

574
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:38,565
- No way. Your homeroom teacher?
- Yes.

575
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:39,607
Wow.

576
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,734
I'll tell you if I hear more.

577
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,821
Promise? You have to tell me.

578
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,576
You're the only one
who listens to me, you know.

579
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:52,162
My mom doesn't believe in my superpower.

580
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:53,746
I believe in it.

581
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:58,668
Oh, hey. Are you busy this Saturday?

582
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:00,920
Saturday? No, I'm not busy.

583
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,256
Can you do me a favor then?

584
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,434
See you later. Bye.

Aloha!

593
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:03,983
God, you have no idea how much
I've waited for you to come back.

594
00:42:03,983 --> 00:42:05,443
How have you been? Let's go.

595
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:09,364
You should've put on a hat.
People are staring.

596
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:13,159
Are you making fun of me?
No one seems to recognize me.

597
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,622
Hey, I managed to keep the press away.
I thought it might overwhelm you.

598
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:21,000
You must've been bored
because you're spewing nonsense.

599
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,711
Come on,
it looks like you want some attention.

600
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,421
You little...

601
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:27,966
Whoa.

602
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:29,509
That's a cool bag.

603
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:30,426
Isn't it?

604
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:34,305
I thought it was pretty cool,
so I got it for you.

605
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:36,140
- Really?
- Here.

606
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,433
Jeong-heon.

607
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:39,894
- Kim Jeong-heon!
- Kim Jeong-heon!

608
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:41,938
Kim Jeong-heon!

609
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,317
WELCOME BACK, KIM JEONG-HEON

610
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:47,902
I'm out.

611
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,445
Come on, Jeong-heon.

612
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:51,990
No backsies.
You've already signed the contract.

613
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,074
Sorry?

Let's make a good show, Ms. On.

617
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:08,339
It's good to see you.

618
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:12,218
You threatened to kill me if I pushed back
the first shoot, and now this?

619
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,554
We're in a serious rush.

MR. SONG IS ON THE MOVE
NEWS FROM THE SCENE

628
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:05,521
All right.

629
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,232
Ready, action.

630
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:11,986
All the latest
from life's humble yet heartfelt scenes.

631
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:15,281
Welcome to Mr. Song Is on the Move,
News from the Scene. I'm Song Ki-baek.

632
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:19,452
Following up on last week, let's discuss
the price gouging at Bbaengdeok Market.

633
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:23,081
Opposition to the views of last week's
consumer representative has emerged.

634
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:26,250
Today, we have a representative
from the Market Merchant Association.

635
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,585
Hello.

636
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:34,050
Hi. I have been running a restaurant
called Bbaengdeok's here

637
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,970
at the Bbaengdeok Market
for the last 20 years.

638
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:44,102
Well... About the price gouging...

639
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:45,061
We...

640
00:44:47,397 --> 00:44:49,107
I don't think I can do this.

641
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:51,943
You said you could do this.
What's with the stutter?

642
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:54,696
When we talked yesterday,

643
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:56,531
you made some really good points.

644
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:58,866
You can just talk like that.

645
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:02,286
Here's an idea.
How about we talk over some rice wine?

646
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:04,580
This is a news show. Is it okay?

647
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,290
We're not that kind of news show.

648
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,584
We've come all the way here
to hear your thoughts.

649
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,711
If you stop here,
you won't be able to sleep.

650
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:14,340
You said you'd do whatever it takes
to save the market.

651
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:17,969
That's right. You're right.

652
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:21,055
Mr. Seong, please get us some rice wine
and a couple of glasses.

653
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,473
Okay.

654
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:26,102
We made some acorn jelly in the morning.
Would you like some?

655
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:27,854
Oh, sure. That'd be awesome.

656
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:29,230
I'll go get it.

657
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,273
All right. Thanks.

658
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,900
Please have a glass
and loosen up a little.

659
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,652
Gee. This is hard.

660
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,364
Isn't being in front of cameras
nerve-racking?

661
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,123
SEONHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
TALENT SHOW

662
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,002
Gu-won said he hoped we could all be here.

663
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:52,295
I think it was last year.

664
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,797
He bawled because his mom had work
and no one came.

665
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:56,257
- He did?
- Yes.

666
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:59,886
He's always fine by himself at the salon,
so I thought he was a mini-adult.

667
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:02,430
He's a child.
There's no such thing as a mini-adult.

668
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,057
This is nice.
It feels like I'm raising a kid again.

669
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,642
- Ki-baek.
- Over here.

670
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:08,478
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

671
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:10,605
I didn't know you guys would be here.

672
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,689
Thank you.

673
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,610
Gu-won is going to be so happy.

674
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,030
I did his makeup. He looks incredible.

675
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,615
He does? Let's go inside.

676
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:21,991
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go.

677
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,159
Yeah, let's go.

678
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:31,083
JUNG GU-WON
LET'S GO

679
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,960
Look, it's Gu-won.

680
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:45,848
Hello. I'm Jung Gu-won
from grade three, class five.

681
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:58,653
Once upon a time, there lived a liar lion
in the faraway Lion Land.

682
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:32,478
Cheese.

683
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:40,152
One day, a rabbit came to the lion.

684
00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:44,282
- Hello, Lion.
- Hello, Rabbit.

685
00:47:44,282 --> 00:47:47,326
Lion, your mane looks amazing.

686
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:50,162
Would you like to enter
the Coolest Animal Contest?

687
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,123
What? No.

688
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:54,834
I've never left this town before.

689
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,878
Don't worry. I got you.

690
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,131
I'm sure you'll be great.

691
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:01,591
I can't do it.

692
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,469
- You can.
- No, I can't.

693
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,430
- Come with me.
- No.

694
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,181
- Come on.
- No!

695
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,559
- Come on, let's go!
- I said no!

696
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,019
Wait for me!

697
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:16,731
I really want you on the show.

698
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:18,816
People trust you. You're perfect.

699
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:20,860
We're headed in different directions.

700
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,613
How dare he lie to my face?

701
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:24,655
Song Ki-baek.

702
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,490
There's something about him.

703
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,744
- Get out of my sight!
- You'll fall!

704
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:33,039
The lion followed the rabbit
and entered the Coolest Animal Contest.

705
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:34,832
COOLEST ANIMAL CONTEST

706
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,168
- Good luck!
- Thanks!

707
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:38,669
It was the lion's turn.

708
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:42,089
Roar!

709
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,300
I'm the coolest lion!

710
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,260
At that moment...

711
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:53,726
My mane!

712
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:56,145
My goodness. Oh, dear.

713
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,356
Poor little guy.

714
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:00,566
The lion's mane was fake!

715
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,276
The lion tricked us.

716
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:04,362
The lion is a liar!

717
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:16,165
- Lion!
- Go away!

718
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:20,670
Lion.

719
00:49:21,504 --> 00:49:23,339
I told you I didn't want to do this!

720
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,132
But what can I do right now?

721
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,468
I'm sick! That is what the doctor said!

722
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:29,512
Mr. Song Ki-baek. Are you all right?

723
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:32,473
Do you think I can host a news show?
I mean, in this state.

724
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,770
Lion, I'm sorry.

725
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,063
Don't follow me!

726
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:46,070
The rabbit felt terrible, blaming herself
for revealing the lion's secret.

727
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:52,326
A lion without a mane.

728
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,704
Everybody will make fun of me
and hate me now.

729
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:09,051
You can still be a cool lion
even without a mane.

730
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:13,681
Liar. I'm nothing without my mane!

731
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:36,787
Then the rabbit came and said...

732
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:42,042
Protect your heart. You're the only one
here who can protect yourself.

733
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:45,504
You said I was your switch. So use me.

734
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:49,383
I'm sure there's something
you can do well without a mane.

735
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,343
I'm right here by your side.

736
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,471
Let's do this together.

737
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,056
Do you think I can do it?

738
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:57,767
Absolutely.

739
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:06,650
Listen. Let's give this a shot.

740
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,242
Help! Help me!

741
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,369
Help me!

742
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:21,665
- Roar!
- The hyenas are trying to eat me!

743
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:23,042
You have to save your friend!

744
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:27,087
I have to hurry,
but my mane is too heavy, and I can't run.

745
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,048
Then take the mane off.

746
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:30,299
You can do this!

747
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:31,550
Okay.

748
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:38,682
Roar!

749
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,226
- Run!
- Run!

750
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:51,529
Are you all right?

751
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,448
Thank you, Lion.

752
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:57,243
You're the coolest lion I've ever seen.

753
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:58,577
- Really?
- Yeah.

754
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:02,873
Your bravery and kind heart
are so much cooler than a nice mane.

755
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,917
Thank you so much.

756
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:09,964
You're awesome. Awesome!

757
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,440
Ouch, that stings.

758
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:33,821
The lion saw the rabbit's small feet
covered in wounds.

759
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,700
Rabbit, why didn't you tell me
you were hurting?

760
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,370
I don't like to make anyone worry.

761
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,456
I'm a rabbit, and I'm nice to everyone.

762
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,542
You can cry when you're hurting.

763
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,003
Sometimes, crying makes you forget
that you're hurting.

764
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,506
You gave me the courage
to take off my mane.

765
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,925
I want to give you courage too.

766
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:09,732
On Woo-ju,
you look really pretty when you smile.

767
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:12,651
But you look very pretty
even when you're not smiling.

768
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:17,781
So just do what you want.

769
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:21,327
Smile when you want to,
and cry when you feel like it.

770
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:24,872
I'll be right by your side,
just like today.

771
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:28,167
The rabbit decided to be brave too.

772
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:30,127
But I...

773
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,342
I'm not okay at all.

774
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:49,104
I thought the only way for me to survive
was to deck myself out with lies

775
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:52,107
and hide my true feelings.

776
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:56,236
The more I hid, the lonelier I felt.

777
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,988
Rabbit, try this on.

778
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:58,906
Okay.

779
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:02,534
How do I look?

780
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,453
You look so cute and super cool.

781
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:05,704
- Really?
- Yeah!

782
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,125
Oh, Lion. Look over there.

783
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,043
Why?

784
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:21,595
Don't bottle it up and hide it.

785
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,639
Be brave and say it out loud.

786
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:25,891
Say you're exhausted and afraid.

787
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:30,187
I'm now happy without a mane!

788
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,316
Tell people you like them and love them.

789
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,029
That lion resembles you, don't you think?

790
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:40,656
Yeah.

791
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,409
Are you crying?

792
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,870
Well, it's so touching.

793
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:08,267
So, did the lion throw away
his precious fake mane?

794
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:09,226
All right.

795
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:10,936
He should throw it away.

796
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:18,110
Actually, the lion hid his fake mane
in a safe place.

797
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:31,040
Because the lion might want to wear
a nice mane from time to time.

798
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,541
He certainly might.

799
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:44,011
But the lion no longer wears the mane
to hide his true self.

800
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,345
That's right.

801
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:49,266
Because the lion is not a liar anymore.

802
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:57,149
Lion, I want to go see
what's beyond the field over there.

803
00:55:57,149 --> 00:56:00,694
Will you come with me?
I'd be too scared to go by myself.

804
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:03,739
The rabbit has also learned how to ask

805
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,617
for her friends' help
without hiding her feelings.

806
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:07,785
Should I go or not?

807
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,621
Well, all right. Let's go together.

808
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:15,334
The lion and the rabbit
remained good friends,

809
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:19,129
living happily together for many years.

810
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:22,049
- Yay! Let's go!
- Yay! Let's go!

811
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:29,973
YOU'RE THE BEST

812
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:33,060
- Terrific!
- Great job!

813
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,523
Attention. Bow.

814
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:43,403
- Bye!
- Bye!

815
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:46,615
- Way to go, Gu-won!
- Great job!

816
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:48,242
Bravo!

817
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:50,035
LET'S GO, GU-WON

818
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,417
Awesome!

819
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:11,348
Here you are, Ki-baek.

820
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,267
Aren't you going to go?

821
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:18,105
It was just a children's play,
but it hit me pretty hard.

822
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,443
Do you want to go up to the stage?

823
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:26,697
Yeah?

824
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,584
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

825
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:45,591
You smile so beautifully these days.

826
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,010
- What?
- You look comfortable.

827
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,970
Different from when I first met you.

828
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,724
Oh, well... You look different too, Woo-ju.

829
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:55,726
Do I?

830
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:06,778
Mr. Lion, do you want to try on the mane?

831
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:07,988
No, forget it.

832
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,991
Are you serious?

833
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,534
Yeah. Here.

834
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:18,665
Let me see.

835
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,753
You look adorable.

836
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,487
MY UNIVERSE

837
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:55,410
The most important
and decisive moments of my life,

838
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,080
you were in every single one of them.

839
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:02,125
The universe is vast and eternal.

840
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,546
Please be my universe
for a long, long time.

841
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,846
Who engraved the outside of the ring?

842
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,515
What is this, The Lord of the Rings?

843
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:18,392
You can't see it if it's on the inside.

844
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:20,060
I did the same with mine.

845
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:34,324
I used to pretend I was fine
no matter how I was actually feeling.

846
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:38,287
You're the first person
I could be honest with.

847
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,249
Thank you.

848
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,649
Is someone there?

849
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,942
What?

850
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,236
What's going on?

851
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:12,863
What are you doing? The show's over.

852
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:14,197
Oh, I'm sorry.

853
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:17,284
Wait, you look familiar.

854
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:21,663
Hi, I'm Song Ki-baek.

855
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:29,046
This is the woman I love very much,
and I just proposed to her.

856
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:33,467
Please turn off the lights
when you leave.

857
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,718
Okay.

858
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:39,681
He already turned all the lights off,
so what did he mean...

859
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,224
What?

860
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:52,235
Wow.

861
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:58,992
It's pretty.

862
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:05,707
Don't you think
you were being too honest?

863
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:09,294
Well, I love you.
How can I possibly hide it?

864
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:13,799
You're right.
When you're in love, you can't hide it.

865
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,465

Mr. Song Ki-baek!

867
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,306
Why do you keep showing up?
Don't come up here!

868
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:45,390
- Go away!
- Don't move!

869
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,683
I said, don't come near me!

870
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,190
-I should enjoy some luxury for a change.
- This is my fight.

871
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,149
-Hey!
- Hey!

872
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:59,446
-Schisandra flowers.
- They mean, "Let's meet again."

873
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,257
- Did you poop?
- No, I did not.

874
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:25,680
Flutter, flutter
Quack, quack

875
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,225
Yes!

876
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:30,519
- Bye!
- Bye!
