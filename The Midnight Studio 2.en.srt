Geez! You think I don't know that?

Maybe you hallucinated since you've been in poor health.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.190
She was definitely alone in the hallway.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.960
She definitely saw the visitor.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.160
I knew I didn't leave the door open.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.640
She was suspicious in the elevator, too.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.970
I've never met anyone like this.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.260
Maybe she came to take over after you.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.290
But the camera has been handed down only within the Seo family.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.330
There's no one to inherit it after you die.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.750
Mr. Seo!

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.180
Geez, you scared me.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.150
You scared me. Can't you use the door?

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.970
I...

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.210
finally found her.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.570
- Found who?
- The long lost...

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.920
first love of mine.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.720
You mean your internet girlfriend?

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.910
I think I'll get very busy soon.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.200
Since I'll be going on dates.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.410
By the way, does she know, too?

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.760
That you're stalking her?

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.950
What do you mean, stalking?

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.990
It's stalking. She can't see you following her around anyway.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.030
Oh, since we're on the topic,

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.620
can I borrow your body if I get to see her again-

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.680
Don't even think about it.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.160
I'm having a hard time because of a strange woman already.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.130
It would've been perfect.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.960
Welcome.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.770
How big is your party?

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.210
I'm alone.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.130
The smallest portion we have is two servings.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.880
It's a party of two.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.440
Two servings of the squid stir-fry, please.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.450
That's the best thing on the menu here.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.670
Okay.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.950
What are you, exactly?

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.030
How come you see that little boy?

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.610
And how did you open the door to the studio?

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.550
Are you bringing that up again?

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.480
I saw what I saw and...

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.050
I opened the door because I could.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.410
It's totally normal.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.500
Is it normal for you, too?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.530
I have a question myself.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.090
What are you, exactly?

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.060
You just moved in

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.400
but how do you know the boy, and why did you visit Ms. Jang?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.810
I thought you ran a photo studio.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.920
Why would a photographer meet with a suspect in a crime?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.510
And why did Jang Bo Ra come clean about everything after she met you?

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.540
Well...

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.720
Am I being interrogated right now?

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.510
Anyway, whatever you are, stop bothering the boy.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.860
He had a hard time because of the accident a month ago.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.510
He needs to leave in three days. Don't try to change his mind.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.500
You know he needs to leave in three days, too?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.040

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.110
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.250
Anyway, that's all the advice I have for you.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.580
Let's eat now.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.080
It's not like we're having a memorial service.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.610
Well...

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.280
you don't get to pay less for eating less.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.090
Eat at least half. One serving each.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.250
Let's hurry up and eat.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.700
It's warm.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.060
Memorial service food is cold.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.680
Memorial service food is for ghosts. We're supposed to eat human food.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.800
Everyone knows that.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.970
It's so good.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.130
What?

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.950
You act like you have never eaten before.

Mr. Seo, you know the rooftop unit-

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.660
I love it very much.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.220

I'm not following you. I'm going to my grandma's place.

Here. It's a coupon for that restaurant.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.630
You get a meal for free if you collect ten stamps.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.460
You know, right? You can't use this alone.

That's how good they are.

There's someone who sees ghosts.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.730
She sees the same things I see?

[Director]

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.480
Hello, Director.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.790
I haven't volunteered there in a while. I'm sorry.

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.340
Attorney Han, is Yoon Dal there, by chance?

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.260
- Pardon?
- Someone saw him following some man earlier today.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:16.360
Yes, I'll look for him, too.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.870
Mr. Baek put his blood and sweat into this special cake.

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.400
Make a wish now.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:52.970
Please make Hyung come back quickly.

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:55.820
Amen...

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.850
Please make sure Yoon Dal doesn't feel afraid.

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.780
Okay. One, two, three.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.680
Happy birthday!

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.860
It's your birthday, too, kiddo.

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.800
Ahjussi.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.460
Goodbye, kiddo.

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.640
Hyung, come back soon.

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.560
Hyung!

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.630
Hyung!

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.560
Hyung!

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.440
Hyung!

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.470
Hyung...

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.690
Don't go.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.290
Hyung!

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.710
Oh, my gosh!

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.310
Thank God!

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.090
Lee Yoon Dal, we were worried about you.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:44.410
I met Yoon Hae just now.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:48.640
The Hyung at the photo studio let me see him.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.840
- What?
- Look at this.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.460
I had a birthday party with Yoon Hae.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.250
He gave me the Biryong Exorcising Sword, too.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.550
This bastard was an awful man.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:40.770
The people who come here ask me.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.240
"Why? For what reason...

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.680
Where's the camera?

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.400
only my life is filled with misfortunes?"

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.850
Where's the camera?

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:28.700
Give me the camera!

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.600
Give me!

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.260
Even though life is...

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.060
filled with misfortunes...

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.050
don't be discouraged.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.010

[The Midnight Studio]

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:30.600
That man is suspicious in so many ways.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.610
He doesn't have a single contact on his phone.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:37.450
I'm a ghost photographer who takes photos of the dead.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.020
I really need you.

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.530
Come to the studio when the sun sets.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.390
You actually see dead people?

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.170
Shit, seriously.

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.330
Don't tell Attorney Han.

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.540
I never came here, okay?

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.240
Stop feeling bad, lady.
