00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.550
Bom.

[Wrong passcode. Please attempt again in 30 seconds.]

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.640
It's not her birthday,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.770
the passcode for the door, or my birthday.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.660
What is it, Grandma?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.830
You like money, Grandma.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.380
I need to send the obituary to invite people.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.320
You said you need to reap what you sow.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.130
But what's the use?

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.020
I can't even collect the money.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.410
You need to get something for me behind Bom's back.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.890
Where's the list of condolence payments?

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.490
Right here.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.400
You can't take anything to the netherworld, ma'am.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.880
I'm not trying to take it. I'm trying to check.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.350
This ledger is my everything.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.870
My loan ledger.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.490
I've been keeping this my entire life.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:50.900
Let's see how much I reaped after what I sowed.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.180
Huh? The Lees who own the produce store.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.730
I sent 100,000 won when his son got married.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.040
But he only gave 50,000 for my funeral? Geez.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.340
Is he serious? I wish I could argue with him right now.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.970
Wow. Nothing's better than fried chicken after physical labor.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.410
You sure enjoy fried chicken.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.440
I won't be able to have tasty food like this once I leave.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.630
You seem to disapprove of me, Mr. Seo.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.650
Have some.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.790
That little...

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.190
Mr. Seo is disapproving of any visitors. Don't worry.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:51.870
I like him a lot if it wasn't for his temper.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.800
How do you do this?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.480
I noticed you were good at it.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.140
Not anyone has this skill.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.450
There's no point in being a ghost at all.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.750
Ghosts can harass people in movies, you know.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.730
They aren't just ghosts. They're resentful or evil ones.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.190
The bastards who hurt people because they're resentful of this world.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.430
By the way, ma'am, I forgot to tell you this.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.040
- Did you hear about my relationship with Bom?
- What?

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.770
About three years ago, I-

Eat.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.700
- The drumsticks are the best.
- Gosh.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.600
Have a wing.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.270
- The chairs...
- What's going on?

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.760
The chairs... The chairs...

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.680
Thank you.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.090
What's that? What's that? What's going on?

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.180
My gosh, it's moving on its own. My gosh.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.060
My gosh. My gosh. Look at that!

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.790
Hey, there's a ghost in our neighborhood! It's a ghost!

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.230
Ghost! Ghost!

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.010
Hold on. Hold on. Wait!

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.130
How do I photograph this? Geez.

[Cherry Blossom Concert for the Ill]

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.960
Why don't we go to Jeju to see flowers?

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.270
- Should we go see cherry blossoms?
- It's summer right now.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.160
They were gone a long time ago.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.110
Well, we can go next year, then.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.980
Spring always comes back.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.030
Just like me.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.020
[Cherry Blossom Concert for the Ill]

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.240
Attorney Han, there are no more guests.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.530
Get some sleep in the chief mourner's room.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.180
You need to hang in there to send her off well.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.020
Sunbae.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.560
Yes?

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.290
She must've really removed me from the family registry.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.630
What are you talking about?

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.230
Other people apparently come back because they can't leave.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.430
Because they miss someone and can't leave.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.640
They go back on a long, treacherous path and return to meet them.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.090
But I suppose Madam So...

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.160
doesn't miss me.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.300
I suppose...

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.070
I've caused nothing but trouble. What right do I have?

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.950
Right?

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.590
Attorney Han.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.630
How foolish.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.690
I didn't even know it would be the last time.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.860
I thought another spring would come again.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.780
I thought they keep coming back.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.390
I think I took too long.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.110
Attorney Han, what are you looking for?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.640
Grandma's phone and purse.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.260
I definitely put them here, but they're gone.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.450
Huh?

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.600
W-What's that?

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.620
Hold on. Let me play it again.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.420
No, it's okay.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.370
I think I know who took them.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.760
That Mr. Yang. I've given him tons of free food.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.720
How could he only give me 30,000 won? Seriously.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.230
You're supposed to give at least 100,000 won for a wedding these days.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.250
Maybe Bom really isn't her biological granddaughter.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.520
She might be better off not knowing.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.140
I can hear everything, Mr. Chatty.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.100
My hearing is as good as a young person's since I'm dead.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.600
- Put it back in.
- O-Okay.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.610
The safe zone?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.390

Attorney Han.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.860
This isn't a funeral portrait. Is it?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.410
You lied when you said she took it a few days ago, right?

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.750
- What are you talking about, exactly?
- Grandma's phone.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.150
Grandma's phone.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.530
You took it and sent the obituary.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.610
Grandma's here, right?

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.770
Where is she?

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.030
Bom.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.930
My heaven.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.660
Have you been eating at all?

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.080
Do you still have anything to say to me?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.440
Let's leave.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.820
Bom...

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.980
Mr. Seo, where's my grandma?

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.940
Bom, let's talk outside.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.260
I don't want to.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.150
Why would I leave? I can't.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.680
Ms. Seo Geum Soon was here. I can't leave until I meet her.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.180
Why are you lying to me? Why?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.840
Did my grandma say...

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.390
she doesn't want to see me?

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.820
Who said so?

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.650
No, ma'am-

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.330
Is she here?

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.070
Right now?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.100
Grandma, do you really not want to see me?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.680
It doesn't matter.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.160
You've been doing whatever you want all this time.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.220
I'll do whatever I want from now on.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.000
Madam So, let's go see the flowers.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.330
Let's go see flowers, Grandma.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.800
There won't be...

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.090
anymore springs.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.920
What are you doing in there?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.670
Wow, her taste is so consistent. It can't be clearer.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.900
This is the flower festival right here.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.220
This would be good for the brunch.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.200
Grandma, I found a cafe with an amazing ocean view.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.010
And for lounging at night...

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.890
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.490
Ask her what she's talking about right now.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.950
Ms. So is asking what you're doing right now.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.410
Mr. Seo, ask her what she prefers between these.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.440
No, this suits her better.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.540
She's picking outfits for you.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.540
Grandma, let's go to Jeju with me.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.450
It's still the hydrangea season there now.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.770
Let's go see flowers right now.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.750
What kind of utter nonsense is this?

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.710
The funeral guests are arriving soon.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.360
Where are you going without collecting my precious money?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.290
You're the chief mourner, okay?

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.340
They're about to come since we sent the obituary.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.990
What are you doing? Tell her, Mr. Seo.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.090
Ms. So is telling you to stay at the funeral home.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.900
Why did you cut out the last part?

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.780
She doesn't like any of these, right?

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.170
I'll put them back, then.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.000
Get it together, you fool.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.550
You need to collect my money.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.120
I gave 50,000 won for Jeong Won's wedding last month.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.830
30,000 won for Yeong Ji's first birthday.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.360
And... Where's my ledger? My ledger.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.270
Why won't you tell her what I said?

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:19.240
I suppose she gave away a lot of money gifts.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.380
She wants to get all of that paid back.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.700
Why do you care about money gifts?

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.350
Is it that important to get back what you gave out?

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.780
Why? What will you do with that money?

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.030
It's not like you can take it with you. Why are you doing this?

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.670
I'll use it for my traveling expenses to the netherworld.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:43.010
So, collect every single penny of my condolence money.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.000
What's the point of doing that?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.740
Don't you find it unfair?

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.550
You've only bought clothes that cost 10,000 won for five to save money.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.470
You never had a meal that cost over 5,000 won at restaurants.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.600
To provide me with food, home, and clothes in my parents' place,

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.640
you never got to see flowers properly

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.030
while so many springs passed by in your life.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.530
You've always wanted to go see flowers,

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.050
but I never took you anywhere.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:17.420
But if you don't see them now, you'll never see them again.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.190
There's no next time anymore, Grandma.

I heard this was your first time taking photos outside despite the risks.

There are a lot of risks and dangers outside the studio.

But you took the photo by taking a risk.

I keep thinking I didn't say goodbye for the last time.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.830
Bom would feel that way, too.

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:09.560
She'll keep reliving the last day with you for the rest of her life.

Why do you think I ended up with Bom?

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.810
She was in an accident...

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:23.720
and she survived alone.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.020
She saw her parents dying while trapped in the car.

She can't be free from that nightmare, either.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.520
Because she feels guilty for surviving alone.

She can't even erase the scar from that day.

I can't let her have another nightmare like that.

I'll charge the same rent.

By the way, Mr. Seo...

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:59.350
when will I stop seeing ghosts?

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.920
Pardon?

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:09.660
It's him, right? The one who insists that he had a blind date with me.

Deputy Go Seong Ho.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.950
Do you see me right now?

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:27.950
Yes, I see you very clearly.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.090
But I know now that I see his face.

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:34.040
I never had a blind date with him. I'm certain.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.580
D-Do you still see him?

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.310
Didn't you say I'll stop seeing them after taking the photo?

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.600
What else do you see?

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.500
A little girl on the earthenware pot.

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.880
And...

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.820
the lady with messy hair in front of the wall.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.950
That man is bleeding a lot.

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:03.780
The man who's bleeding next to the car.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.300
Huh? He's the jeweler who passed away last year.

And a lady is waving her hand up in the air.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.040
But I never thought about what complication would appear

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.780
I see everything. Very clearly.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.470
when the one-of-a-kind camera and the one-of-a-kind

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:34.910
mutant encounter one another.

I don't care what it is. Find out if there were similar cases.

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:06.930
Why is she always an exception?

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.550
She came in where she wasn't supposed to.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:12.050
You have a buddy. A buddy who sees ghosts.

Since I moved into this place, strange things started happening to Bom.

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:23.200
The safe zone or whatever. I'm not safe. It doesn't work on me.

Let's try to be apart from each other and not cross paths.
