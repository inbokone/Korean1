Oh, you must be nervous. Your hands are sweaty.

The person who'll be joining us

is more handsome than me. He's younger too.

I enjoyed the webtoon you posted on your blog.

33

You get many calls from everywhere, don't you?

34
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,597
Since your art style is remarkable.

35
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:31,247
When did you begin to draw?

36
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,087
I actively started drawing

37
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:38,627
while preparing for college admissions...

38
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:43,567
So I actually started earlier than that... At the time, I was...

39
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,217
Well...

40
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:49,857
I told you to relax. It's okay. Loosen up.

41
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,067
As I explained,

42
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,247
the game we're planning is a dating simulation.

43
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:58,247
It's an interactive game similar to our previous game.

44
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,427
It's school-related and geared toward females.

45
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,707
So when I saw your webtoon, I thought you were perfect.

46
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:06,717
I contacted you before anyone else could steal you.

47

Mr. Lee Wan?

48
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,817
Have you played our previous game?

49
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,417
Yes, I have.

50
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,857
- What about the ending?
- The ending?

51
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,997
I don't remember accurately,

52
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,217
but I think it had to do with escaping the building.

53
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:28,667
I see... an ending where you escape?

54
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,817
Yes, escaping from the building...

55
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:41,247
Yes, I think I escaped...

56
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,317
Our game was fun, right?

57
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,787
Yes, it was fun.

58
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,837
Lee Wan, there is nothing more to be said about your art. It's incredible.

59
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:59,587
This is your first job at a company, right?

60
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,907
Yes.

61
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:03,947
I will ask you some questions.

62
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,010
What would you do if the art style requested

63
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,497
by our company is different from the style you want?

64
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:16,107
First, I'd propose a compromise and try to accommodate...

65
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,047
No compromise.

66
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:22,237
You must give one up. What then?

67
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,077
Then...

68
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:30,307
I think I'd proceed with the style requested by the company.

69
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,997
Second question.

70
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:36,287
If you receive a recruitment offer from another company during a project,

71
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,457
what would you do?

72
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:43,747
If it's an excellent offer, I'd ask them to wait until our project is over-

73
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:47,537
If you don't choose immediately, that opportunity will pass you by.

74
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,597
You can't delay it. What would you do?

75
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,287
Well...

76
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,137

77
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:11,557
All right. I see.

78

Our goal is to launch an app.

79
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:20,957
You'll be given three months. You will be working late,

80
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:24,237
and there will be disagreements, so because of that,

81
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,887
if you run away in the middle,

82
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,097
it'll be hard to work together, right?

83
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:32,837
You just need to hang in there for three months.

84
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,897
Geez, so scary.

85
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,557
He's just trying to scare you. Don't be too burdened.

86
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:43,787

329
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:23,595
we contacted you first after viewing your blog.

330
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:26,155
Your first and second-round submissions were very good.

331
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,905
Therefore, we really wanted to have you join us.

332
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,205
I see.

333
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:35,165
If you join the camp, you'll be abroad for at least one year. Are you okay with that?

334
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,885
Yes. I'm okay with that.

335
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,765
Are you sure?

336
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,615
When drawing, what do you start with?

337
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:48,065
Well, usually...

338
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:50,685
I start with the face.

339
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:52,395
The face?

340
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,895
This face...

341
00:23:57,165 --> 00:24:00,435
Did you know there's only one face in your webtoons?

342
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,755
All the characters have the same face.

343
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:06,855
The same expressions and the same dialogue.

344
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:13,105
Are you unable... to abandon this character?

345
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,565
Mr. Wan, our camp needs an artist

346
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:25,735
who can draw various pictures with a wide spectrum.

347
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:30,045
An artist who's buried in one story and one emotion...

348
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:33,915
can only draw one face.

349
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:38,895
It will be difficult for you to join us for this camp,

350
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,525
but I hope to see you again soon.

351
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:42,985
Well, then...

352
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,355
Producer Ahn!

353
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,035
I still thank you.

354
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,565
I gained a lot of courage thanks to your comments on my blog

355
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,055
for the past few years.

356

Gameboy?

359
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:10,215
Aren't you the one who's been posting comments on my blog?

360
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:13,625
The nickname was Gameboy.

361
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:17,985
It wasn't me. I'll get going.

362
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:29,015
Then who is Gameboy?

363
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:34,885
Hey, Nuna. I'm on my way to Daejeon.

364
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:40,965
Who...

365
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:44,785
Hello. I'm Theo, CEO of the gaming company, Re:Try.

366
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:48,165
I'd like to meet you to discuss a character creation job.

367
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:50,855
I'm contacting you through your blog, "Cartoon Diaries."

368
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:54,165
How do you feel about meeting at 11 a.m. tomorrow?

369
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,845
An opportunity that seemed to have dropped from the sky.

370
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:04,185
I stood at the crossroads of choices once again.

371
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:08,955
This is CEO Theo of Re:Try. Did you get home safely?

372
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:12,775
Let's work on this project together, Author Lee.

373
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,495
I'm sorry.

This episode was very fun too.

00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,945
I hope the main character, Ian, won't run away in the next episode.

Of course, this is my personal opinion.

I don't know who you are, but thank you for always rooting for me.

I'll try not to run away this time.

381
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:54,695
Thanks to this mysterious support, I chose not to run away this time.

382
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:59,305
Since it could be different this time.

Hello. You're here early.

389
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:55,353
Hello! My name is Lee Wan, and this is my first day.

390
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:58,393
Oh, you scared me. I'm Jamie.

391
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,763
We met when you came for the interview, right?

392
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,263
- Yes.
- Okay, follow me.

393
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:07,823
The Mr. Wan we've been waiting for has arrived for work!

394
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:10,643
Goodness! You're here early.

395
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,023
I've been waiting a long time.

396
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:17,113
Finally, our Wan-

397
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,623
But your clothes are...

398
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:23,403
I told you to wear comfortable clothes.

399
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:28,533
You did... But it's still my first day, so...

400
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:31,913
Okay. Have you thought about it?

401
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:35,123
- Sorry?
- Your gaming nickname.

402
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:38,503
We call each other by our nicknames.

403
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,813
I'll think about it.

404
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:45,613
Well, I'm The-o... Theo.

405
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,613
You have already met Jamie, right?

406
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:52,763
Oh, and you saw Eddy at the interview.

407
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:55,053
He'll be here soon. Oh, and Sunny.

408
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:59,763
Sunny is always exhausted, but she's a skilled developer.

409
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:06,363
She actually lost her voice after catching a cold from staying up four nights.

410
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:10,463
We welcome you. Welcome to "Zombie World."

411
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,683
Take a look around. There are a lot of fun things.

412
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:16,233
Like this, and this, and this.

413
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:41,806
- Excuse me.
- Oh, you scared me.

414
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:44,586
This is my seat.

415
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,346
Oh, okay.

416
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:26,950
Here.

417
00:30:27,522 --> 00:30:29,012
Thank you.

418
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:32,039
I'm sorry there's a lot of work, although it's your first day.

419
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,762
It's okay. It's not like I didn't know.

420
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,710
- It's fun.
- Okay.

421
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,100
I heard you'll be using the night duty room for three months.

422
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,490
Yes, I don't really have a place to stay.

423
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,160
I see.

424
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,520
The night duty room is nice. It's really cozy, so use it comfortably.

425
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,380
Whether it's night or day.

426
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,720
By the way,

427
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,060
your clothes are making me feel uncomfortable.

428
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,900
- Should I take this off for you?
- No, no.

429
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,140
I can take it off.

430
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,500
Theo, was the plan we came up with yesterday confirmed?

431
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,370
Oh, that? Let me check.

432
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,740
Let me know within an hour so we can start working on it.

433
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,860
I told you I would.

434
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,350
You can wear this. I don't wear this anymore.

435
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,940
You get the gist of our game, right?

436
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,630
Then please prepare the review for our next meeting.

437
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,720
Sorry? What about the draft you told me to prepare?

438
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,490
That should also be done by our next meeting.

439
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,630
A review is pretty simple.
It's about what you saw and felt.

440
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,810
Why? Is that too difficult?

441
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,920
No, no.

442
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,240
I'll have it ready by our next meeting.

443
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,260
Okay. Please show it to me first before the meeting.

444
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,030
Good luck.

445
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,910
- Excuse me...
- Is this everything for the draft?

446
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:08,980
I didn't have much time after I finished the review.

447
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,570
And this is it... for the review too?

448
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,600
I kept getting "game over" whenever I played,

449
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
so I couldn't even reach the restage.

450
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,060
You quit playing the game

451
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,430
because you kept getting "game over."

452
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,440
That means our game wasn't fun.

453
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,290
- That's not it.
- No.

454
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,750
You will play a fun game (until the end), no matter how many times you lose.

455
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,160
Even if you have to pull an all-nighter.

456
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,800
Since you want to reach the end.

457
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Now, let's think about why you didn't find our game fun.

458
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Number one, because you weren't curious about the end.

459
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,460
Number two, because the options weren't fun.

460
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,400
Number three, because you just didn't focus.

461
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,090
Why aren't you focusing when you're here to work?

462
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,330
Please do your best.

463
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,620
Number two.

464
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,350
Sorry?

465
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,200
The options weren't fun.

466
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,160
Go on.

467
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,610
These options don't reflect real users' feelings.

468
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,320
You feel even more pathetic and desperate when you want to return to a particular moment.

469
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,260
But these don't reflect any of that.

470
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,760
Of course, I'm talking about the game here...

471
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,630
Wait, so... going back like this.

472
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,350
If they could turn back time,

473
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,904
what options should we provide?

474
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,010
Yes, well... that's good criticism.

475
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,380
Then could you create a list of options that reflects the pathetic sentiment of the users?

476
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
By tomorrow's meeting.

477
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,970
I think it will also be good to touch up on the character draft too.

478
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,891
Then I'll leave it to you.

479
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,680
Did you choose your nickname yet?

480
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,690
Ian!

481
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,680
It's the name of the main character of your blog's webtoon.

482
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,580
Use that as your nickname.

483
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,830
When did he read my blog?

484
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,520
Did Theo show it to him?

485
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,020
Then did he already read all that?

486
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,570
Geez, he's getting on my nerves.

487
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,100
Isn't this workplace harassment or something like that?

488
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,390
Going back like this.

489
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,420
If they could turn back time...

490
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,890
When will I finish all this? Oh my gosh.

491
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,710
Goodness, Wan. Your face is...

492
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,930
What happened?

493
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,620
I couldn't sleep last night.

494
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,500
It's okay. You're still handsome.

495
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,130
Look at our CEO's face. He still looks like that after a full night's sleep.

496
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,960
Jamie.

497
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,680
Okay, okay. Shall we get started? Wan.

498
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,950
Oh, Ian. Please present the review you prepared.

499
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,620
Ian?

500
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,340
The name of the main character of Wan's webtoon! Ian. That's right.

501
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,110
Good choice.

502
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,700
All right then, Ian. Please go ahead.

503
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,520
I think there should be more options

504
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,300
leading to ambiguous situations between the two of them.

505
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,440
Right now, it feels like their affections are too rushed.

506
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,200
When you have a crush, those ambiguous moments are the most heart-fluttering.

507
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
Whoa, Ian! You must've experienced a lot of unrequited love.

508
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,690
It's nothing like that.

509
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,750
But if the options are too ambiguous,

510
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,470
don't you think the users might feel confused?

511
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,130
Yes,

512
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,600
but that's how someone in an unrequited love behaves.

513
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,230
- It doesn't really go according to your plan.
- But...

514
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,210
this is a game, not reality.

515
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,760
Well, let's hear Ian's opinion.

516
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,650
He's the first member who can point out anything we missed.

517
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,790
Right now, the only function is to send and receive messages with the characters,

518
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,780
but what if we add a character's SNS function?

519
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,880
SNS?

520
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,980
You know how we all scroll through our crush's SNS?

521
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,730
What they like, what music they listen to,

522
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,690
and if they found any new love interests.

523
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,690
We can also provide hints on what the character is feeling.

524
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,060
Wow, Ian's idea is rather good.

525
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,770
Gosh! Are you an expert on unrequited love or what?

526
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,230
Yes, well... sounds good.

527
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,940
This is a really great idea,

528
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,030
but we don't have much time until the launch of the test version.

529
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,430
Can we add this in?

530
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,060
We can. We can't abandon this idea because it's that great.

531
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,120
Let's confirm all possible aspects

532
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,050
and apply them before the official launch.

533
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,530
Okay.

534
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,620
All right, our planning team should now get into more specific planning.

535
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,240
Ian, you can give us some reference materials.

536
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,630
- And please start the drawings in more detail.
- Yes.

537
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,730
Good job, everyone.

538
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,220
End of meeting. Shall we have a company dinner?

539
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,640
- We need to go planning.
- Yes, I'm aware.

540
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,360
Why is he so chic?

541
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Your idea is nice, Ian.

542
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,080
Eddy has a good eye for people.

543
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,490
He wouldn't stop recommending you to us.

544
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,220
Did Sunny just speak?

545
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,150
Sunny! Your voice is back!

546
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,210
Daebak! I almost forgot your voice.

547
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,400
Who recommended whom?

548
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,610
Eddy recommended you.

549
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,500
He discovered your blog and showed it to us.

550
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,560
Even though we warned him it was risky on our part due to our tight schedule,

551
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,760
Eddy's the one who kept pushing through.

552
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
Eddy suggested we wait for you.

553
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,660
Exactly.

554
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,510
Do you know how much Eddy argued with Sunny, insisting it had to be you, Ian?

555
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,710
How could he have recognized such a blessing?

556
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,110
Can I give you a hug? Come here.

557
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,230
Excuse me. Can we have a talk?

558
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,490
Did I do something wrong?

559
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,790
Why did you suddenly ask me to come to the rooftop?

560
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,180
- Ian?
- It's you, isn't it?

561
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,080
The one who recommended me.

562
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,479
You?

563
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,580
You know who I am, don't you? You're acting like this knowing who I am, right?

564
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,730
Of course, I know you. Why wouldn't I know you?

565
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,200
Then why didn't you tell me?

566
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,320
Are you trying to make me look like a fool? Are you having fun?

567
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,390
What am I supposed to do when we met at work?

568
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,770
I only played along since you seemed uncomfortable with me.

569
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,120
- What are you trying to do after all this time?
- What?

570
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,390
Everything is already over.

571
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,650
What did you bring me into the company for?

572
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,160
What do you think? To work together.

573
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,470
Are you doing this intentionally to harass me?

574
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,460
Why would I harass you?

575
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,110
Our company just happened to need an illustrator,

576
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,700
and I somehow discovered your webtoon and liked your illustrations.

Don't you remember I...

And don't make things difficult for me for no reason.

580
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,550
When did I ever make it difficult for you?

581
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,240
I just taught an incompetent newbie how to work.

No one is good at what they do when they start.

583
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,160
Just wait three months. I'll do better than you.

584
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,240
All right then. Don't you dare run away in the middle of it.

Hey! Is it fun toying around with me?

587
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,790
You, stay out of my sight.

588
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,060
How could I? There are only five people at our company.

589
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,550
- You don't know, do you?
- Know what?

590
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,880
Of course, you don't.

I couldn't resist starting a conversation with you. I was too happy.

00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,990
Why... Why would you...

595
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,710
Wait, why... why would you search and read that?

596
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,220
You know this is basically stalking right now.

597

Didn't you say why just now?

598
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,590
The reason we look through our crush's SNS.

599

You know how we all scroll through our crush's SNS?

00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,370
Oh, I have a really cute friend.
Should I introduce them to each other?

650
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,050
Is Ian dating anyone?

651
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,920
I don't think he is.

652
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,460
Then should I go ahead and do so? Should I?

653
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,940
- Who is it? Who is it?
- Someone you don't know.

654
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,390
What's with the informal speech? Who is it?

655
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,610
Hello.

656
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,060
- Welcome.
- For one person.

657
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,580
All right.

658
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,380
Why is he like that? Seriously.

659
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,260
"I can't stomach anything because he's too handsome"?

660
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,430
Gosh. I'm so dumbfounded.

661
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,150
"He's handsome"?

662
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,380
Your food is ready.

663
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,060
Thank you.

664
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,450
Sure, enjoy your meal.

665
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,780
I thought you said you weren't eating.

666
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,470
I see you ran away all the way here.

667
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,650
Could you be the one to leave since I'm already eating?

668
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,050
Okay, I'll leave. Oh, but I'll pay the bill-

669
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,500
I'll pay for it. Don't be like this.

670
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,340
The company card. This is how I treat my other colleagues.

671
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,930
I didn't cross the line, nor did I stalk you.

672
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,990
Hey...

673
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,960
Aigo.

674
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,350
Were you saving this for later?

675
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,630
Lunch will be over in fifteen minutes.

676
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,020
Hurry and eat. I will leave.

677
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,150
I'll pay the bill.

678
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,450
Ian. Hurry and place your bet, Ian.

679
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,080
It's Sunny vs. Eddy. Bet on whom you think will win.

680
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,340
Is there something to gain by winning?

681
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,380
Yes, the winner gets a wish.

682
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,130
The loser and the people who bet on them pay for tomorrow's lunch.

683
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,780
For your information, Theo and Jamie have bet on me.

684
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,260
- I choose Sunny, too.
- You're quite wise.

685
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,830
I'll show you what I've got.

686
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,630
Then four against one.

687
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:18,070
Okay, then. Start!

688
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,220
No, no!

689
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,090
Can she? She did!

690
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,750
- That's right.
- Whoa.

691
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,550
- I'm going, I'm going.
- Left, left.

692
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,050
What do you mean? Go right.

693
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,050
What the...? What's with the two of you?

694
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,140
Gosh, Ian. What the heck?

695
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,600
No, no, it's not like that.

696
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,700
We're a great team, don't you think?

697
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,680
All of a sudden?

698
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,470
Thank you, Ian.

699
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,600
Anyhow, I'll be using the wish today.

700
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,580
Eddy, what will you wish for?

701
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,170
You can't ask to get off work right now.

702
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,700
Not getting off work...

703
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,900
- Working off site.
- What?

704
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,280
Ian is going to leave later for additional sketches.

705
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,360
I'll accompany him since he's probably going to need a model. Is that all right?

706
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,480
What? I don't- What if I don't want that?

707
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,870
It doesn't matter what you want. It's my wish.

708
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,460
You're following him to harass him again, aren't you?

709
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,760
No, I'm going to keep an eye on him so he doesn't wander off.

710
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,120
I have no reason to deny his wish since he's using it for work.

711
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,810
Make sure to keep all the receipts.

712
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,040
- It's my turn.
- Hurry and come. You don't even have a car.

713
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,820
Ready, start.

714
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,620
This is all or nothing, right?

715
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,230
[Dream Garden]

716
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,410
Didn't you say we should work?

717
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,380
We're here to work.

718
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,220
You said you needed to sketch a background of a school.

719
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,310
That's not what I meant. Why did we come here when there are countless schools in Seoul?

720
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,590
Isn't this school better than asking an unfamiliar school for permission to enter?

721
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,430
We're allowed here since we're graduates from here.

722
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,620
I'll take care of the sketches, so just don't distract me.

723
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,950
Whoa, it's been so long!

724
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,010
We need to work.

725
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,290
Wait! Stay like that.

726
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,180
What... Like this?

727
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,650
No, that makes too many shadows, so turn this way.

728
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,820
Yes, stay like that.

729
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,300
Hey. How long do I need to stay like this?

730
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,440
Don't move.

731
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,500
Are you tired already? Why did you follow me then?

732
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,860
Didn't you get a sketch thanks to me?

733
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,970
I can draw even without you there.

734
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,500
Wait, then why did you tell me to stay like-

735
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,810
You did all the talking.

736
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,850
How long must I stay like this?

737
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,720
As an illustrator, I need to catch even the smallest details.

738
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,620
Front, side, back, everything.

739
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,120
Let's go to the next location.

740
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,120
What? Are you already done?

741
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,880
For a while now.

742
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,130
Nothing has changed here.

743
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,610
Right?

744
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,410
Let me see, too. What are you drawing?

745
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,520
I see...

746
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,710
In this part, you should-
- What are you doing?

747
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,690
This is really the last place, right?

748
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,540
Go rest in the car if you're tired.

749
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,130
Or you can give me the card and leave first.

750
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,040
Why do you need the card?

751
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:23,120
You have the car, and I need to get a ride from the taxi.

752
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,950
You always get the last word.

753
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,140
Yes, I won't lose anymore.

754
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,610
Aigo, you say that like

755
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,090
you have let me win in the past.

756
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,010
Just don't get in my way.

757
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,500
By the way, I have something to ask you.

758
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,580
Didn't you take photos with a film camera

759
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,010
to make drawings with them in the past?

760
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,120
I don't take photos.

761
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,840
Why not?

762
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,240
What about that film camera from before?

763
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,450
Why do you have that?

764
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,610
I found this while looking for you.

765
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:34,000
What? Why would you... Hey, why would you pick up something I threw out?

766
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,810
Why did you throw it out?

767
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,680
- Give it to me.
- Why did you throw it out?

768
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,560
- Give it to me.
- No.

769
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,990
- Hand it over.
- No.

770
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,030
- Give it to me! Please!
- I said no.

771
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,660
Please...

772
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,570
stop harassing me.

773
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,740
Are you running away again?

774
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,040
What?

775
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,960
Fine, I'll just be left behind again.

776
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,230
I was always the one left behind because you always misunderstood and ran away.

777
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,720
Hey, Lee Wan.

778
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,850
I searched for you for a long time.

779
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,620
But I couldn't reach you,

780
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,100
nor could I find you anywhere I thought you'd be.

781
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,420
There was nothing I could do.

782
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,590
Have you been well? Without me?

783
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,900
I'm harassing you? No.

784
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,380
You're the one who harassed me for seven years.

785
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,930
Hey...

786
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,020
I won't let you go anymore.

787
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,500
I like you.

788
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,840
What?

789
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:51,894
Aside from the classroom and hallway, I also drew other parts of the school in detail.

790
00:56:51,894 --> 00:56:55,258
Places and things like the field, bleachers, and benches.

791
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:58,618
These are where good memories are mostly made.

792
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:02,902
Like your favorite spot at school that you visit often.

793
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:06,552
I like it. It's somewhat sentimental and romantic.

794
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:07,932
Yes, very good.

795
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:10,412
What about the character's appearance?

796
00:57:12,022 --> 00:57:14,179
That's most important.

797
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:16,919
Have you already finished the sketch of the character?

798
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:20,529
It's only a sketch, but I applied your description of the character

799
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:23,229
and illustrated it according to my style.

800
00:57:24,419 --> 00:57:26,219
Wow.

801
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,019
I like it.

802
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:33,089
But doesn't this look familiar?

803
00:57:33,089 --> 00:57:37,289
No way. It's rare to see someone this handsome these days.

804
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:39,719
I like it.

805
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:42,629
Doesn't this look like Eddy?

806
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:47,539
The facial features are somewhat similar to Eddy's handsome features.

807
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:53,739
Are they? Yes, they are! They are similar.

808
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:55,389
You're wrong.

809
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:00,999
He's way more handsome. The character.

810
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:05,099
Although, Eddy is really handsome,

811
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:08,509
there's no 3D that can beat a 2D.

812
00:58:08,509 --> 00:58:10,799
You guys are so harsh.

813
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,659
Gosh. Are the gates of hell opening now?

814
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:19,019
All right, the remaining time until the launch of the beta test

815
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:20,989
is a mere forty hours.

816
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:24,839
And now... the hell of overtime begins.

817
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,489
Okay, everyone!

818
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:31,509
Raise your arms up and say "Fighting!" on three. One, two three!

819
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,019
Fighting!

820
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:38,006
[12:18 a.m.]

821
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:41,978
I'm exhausted.

822
00:58:46,752 --> 00:58:49,512
Do you still have a lot left to do?

823
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:52,522
Well, just a bit.

824
00:58:52,522 --> 00:58:55,272
Do you want to drink something? Coffee?

825
00:58:55,272 --> 00:58:56,702
It's on me.

826
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:59,742
It's okay. I don't drink coffee at night.

827
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,892
Then drink this.

828
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:21,252
Thank you.

829
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:31,069
You must be tired. Work on the rest at home.

830
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:34,442
I'll give you a ride.

831
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:40,075
It's comfortable here, and it's not like I have a place to go to.

832
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:41,755
What do you mean?

833
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:45,925
I've been living in the night duty room since I'm only here temporarily.

834
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:47,675
The night duty room?

835
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:57,175
Hey, how can you carelessly sleep in a place where anyone can come and go? It's dangerous.

836
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:01,025
What's so dangerous?

837
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:03,765
And what does it matter to you?

838
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:07,155
Why wouldn't it? I like you-

839
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,055
I said, I like you.

840
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:40,145
Oh, t-then I'll stay at a nearby café or room...

841
01:00:40,145 --> 01:00:42,135
Let's work elsewhere.

842
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:25,715
Here's a beer since we're off the clock now.

843
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:34,395
A drink after work.

844
01:01:37,765 --> 01:01:39,745
I'm going to wash up first.

845
01:01:42,245 --> 01:01:43,605
What were you imagining?

846
01:01:43,605 --> 01:01:46,335
Nothing like that.

847
01:01:48,285 --> 01:01:51,125
Why are you surprised? How strange.

848
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,775
It's nothing. Go wash up now. What are you saying?

849
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,755
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

850
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,225
Nothing.

851
01:02:58,515 --> 01:03:00,765
Do you believe me now?

852
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:03,235
What?

853
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:06,015
That I like you.

854
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:10,715
I'm going to work in the next room now.

855
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:15,095
There's a towel in the bathroom,

856
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,925
and I left a change of clothes over there.

857
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,230
The bedroom is over there.

858
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,015
Are we sleeping together?

859
01:03:23,785 --> 01:03:27,345
Well... there's only one bed.

860
01:03:28,795 --> 01:03:32,895
Hey, it's okay. I can sleep here. It's pretty nice here.

861
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:36,415
Whatever you want, but you may catch a cold.

862
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:56,995
He's the one who suggested working overtime.

863
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,665
Do they look that similar?

864
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:27,655
[This is really exhausting. I'm exhausted. I want to run away.]

865
01:04:28,775 --> 01:04:34,785
Are you unable... to abandon this character?

866
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,345
What the...

867
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:26,546
It's been a while... since I last saw this expression.

868
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:38,075
Hey. Be honest with me.

869
01:05:39,385 --> 01:05:41,765
You still like me, don't you?

870
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,835
You're still the same.

Gosh, finally.

Everyone! The beta test link has finally been posted.

877
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:19,925
Thank you for your hard work, everyone!

878
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,775
This is only the beginning of hardships.

879
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,985
Please follow up on the feedback for your assigned domains.

880
01:07:26,985 --> 01:07:30,865
- Please organize a list for us, Jamie.
- Okay!

881
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:35,645
Oh, how about a... company dinner, huh? A company dinner.

882
01:07:35,645 --> 01:07:37,475
How does that sound?

883
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:39,325
Let's have some meat!

884
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:41,555
We couldn't eat properly for the past few days.

885
01:07:41,555 --> 01:07:43,135
- I'm hungry.
- Okay!

886
01:07:43,135 --> 01:07:44,795
Let's go eat some meat.

887
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:46,645
Yay!

888
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,365
Ian, what kind of meat do you like?

889
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,905
I like any kind of meat.

890
01:07:49,905 --> 01:07:52,235
Oh, really? Then let's have some beef.

891

- Hurry up. Hurry, hurry.
- Go, go. Sunny!

892
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,475
Hurry. Come on.

893
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:57,615
- Okay.
- Sunny, you, too.

894
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:02,395
Cheers.

895
01:08:04,355 --> 01:08:08,705
I didn't think you would ask me out after dinner.

896
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,755
Do you have something to say?

897
01:08:17,755 --> 01:08:20,075
Not really.

898
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:22,815
Your expression says otherwise.

899
01:08:23,885 --> 01:08:26,135
No, no.

What is it?

901

You have been working hard the past few days,

902
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:38,925
so I wanted to say that you did well. Good work.

903
01:08:38,925 --> 01:08:41,115
That's not it.

904
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:47,855
Well, I'm thankful you recruited me into the company. And...

905
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:49,815
You like me, don't you?

906
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:52,225
Huh?

907
01:08:52,225 --> 01:08:57,825
I believe you still like me, no matter how hard I think about it.

908

What are you saying?

909

Your face is flushed.

910
01:09:14,788 --> 01:09:16,848
It's because I'm drunk.

Did he go for round two with Eddy last night?

918
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:16,189
Gosh, he's adorable.

919
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:18,149
You're too much.

920
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:21,699
I have found a match for Ian.

921
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,309
Good morning.

922
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:24,739
Oh, you're here.

Let's get started, everyone.

924
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:31,989
Hey, Ian.

925
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:37,689
Why are you so surprised?

926
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:40,859
I have something to say, so follow me.

927
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:42,979
Right now?

928
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:45,129
Yes, right now.

929
01:10:57,389 --> 01:11:01,609
The alert screen is missing after this button is clicked.

930
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:05,689
It would be great if you could add it while editing the profile page.

931
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:07,809
Oh, okay.

932
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:12,359
Oh, you have nothing to write with.

933
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:15,299
I'll organize everything and send it to you.

934
01:11:15,299 --> 01:11:20,689
Also... your answer is?

935
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:25,239
Excuse me? Wh-What answer?

936
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,149
Don't you remember last night?

937
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:31,159
Last night, you and I were both drunk.

938
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:33,339
I wasn't drunk.

939
01:11:33,339 --> 01:11:36,119
I just acted drunk because I was embarrassed.

940
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:41,359
Then... were you being sincere?

941
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:45,349
Would you kiss someone for fun?

942
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:46,979
Hey, hey...

943
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:54,849
Anyhow, don't you like me?

944
01:11:58,519 --> 01:12:00,059
You can give it a try.

945
01:12:00,059 --> 01:12:02,269
What?

946
01:12:02,269 --> 01:12:04,699
You can give it a try.

947
01:12:06,509 --> 01:12:09,139
Try what?

948
01:12:09,139 --> 01:12:12,289
If you really like me...

949
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:16,019
you can try having a crush on me for a little longer.

950
01:12:27,689 --> 01:12:30,199
You're driving me crazy.

951
01:12:31,589 --> 01:12:35,739
I'll organize what we couldn't discuss in a file and send it to you.

952
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:38,209
All right, Ian?

953
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,229
Ian!

954

Yes. Get ready and come out.

You've never been in unrequited love, have you?

969
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:08,189
Hello?

970

Hey, Wan, you know... is it okay for you to talk right now?

Yes.

972
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:19,769
I somehow got my hands on some exhibition tickets.

973
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:24,149
If you don't have any plans, do you want to go together?

974

Not sure...

975

I don't really like exhibitions.

976
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:39,439
Is that so? That's what I thought. Then let's go somewhere you want to go.

977
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:41,289
I'll wait.

978
01:14:42,469 --> 01:14:44,529
Sure then...

979
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,239
I'll think about it.

980
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:49,629
Okay.

981
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:23,346
I feel like you'll only go on park dates until you're a grandpa.

982
01:15:23,346 --> 01:15:25,751
I like calm places.

983
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:27,119
Okay, Grandpa.

984
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:29,039
Stop that.

985
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,329
Wan, can I ask you something?

986
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:34,179
Sure.

987
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:36,429
How much longer do I have to do this?

988
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:40,619
This unrequited love.

989
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:47,189
Well. I'm not sure.

990
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:52,229
You still have a long way to go if you want to measure up to what I did.

991
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:54,899
Do you even know when my unrequited love started?

992
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:57,459
When did it start?

993
01:15:57,459 --> 01:15:59,349
I'm not sure.

994
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:03,039
Ever since my Wan disappeared.

995
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:06,249
Longer than you think, huh?

996
01:16:06,249 --> 01:16:10,379
So hurry up. I really don't like unrequited love.

997
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:12,369
It's so frustrating.

998
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:18,479
Then did you really like me back then, too?

999
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,979
That's what I'm telling you. You asked the same thing last time as well.

1000
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:24,339
If you can't believe me, then don't.

1001
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:29,106
Then have you never dated even once?

1002
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,456
What?

1003
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:35,229
That's...

1004
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:39,279
Hey, Wan, should we go somewhere else?

1005
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:41,429
It's too hot here. It's too hot.

1006
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:44,479
Stop changing the subject. Hurry and spill it.

1007
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,009
It was once during my freshman year in college when I didn't know any better.

1008
01:16:48,009 --> 01:16:50,019
It was just once, really.

1009
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:51,979
Gosh, look at this.

1010
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:55,199
This seven-year unrequited love was all a lie.

1011
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,229
It's not a lie.

1012
01:16:57,229 --> 01:17:02,689
Wan, you know... I can only date someone I really like...

1013
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:05,439
Someone I sincerely like.

1014
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:10,229
I wasn't happy at all dating that person.

1015
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:15,349
Then date me.

1016
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:16,849
What?

1017
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:23,049
I said you can date me.

1018
01:17:27,419 --> 01:17:29,409
Really?

1019
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:31,889
Forget it if you don't want to.

1020
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:40,029
Hey, Wan. Did you ever date anyone?

1021
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,325
Of course, I did. Of course.

1022
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,989
You did? Whom?

1023
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:46,799
Who's the guy?

1024
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:49,809
There is this guy. I mean...

1025
01:17:49,809 --> 01:17:54,479
There was this good guy that you don't know.

1026
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,559
So you did date?

1027
01:17:57,559 --> 01:17:59,499
You have dated.

1028
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:06,049
For goodness' sake, I didn't. Are you happy now?

1029
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,509
I'm happy.

1030
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:15,579
And don't wear your hair like this. It's annoying.

1031
01:18:15,579 --> 01:18:19,349
Whoa, are you controlling your boyfriend?

1032
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:20,549
What are you saying?

1033
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:24,439
Wait for me. Wait for me!

1034
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:08,519
You're such a comic otaku.

1035
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:13,129
I acknowledge that you chose the perfect career for yourself.

1036
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:18,529
And you?

1037
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,269
You're right.

1038
01:19:23,789 --> 01:19:26,839
Wan, being like this

1039
01:19:26,839 --> 01:19:29,879
feels like we have returned to high school.

1040
01:19:29,879 --> 01:19:33,399
We always ditched P.E. and stayed in the classroom.

1041
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:37,559
I played games, and you read comics. That's how we became close.

1042
01:19:37,559 --> 01:19:40,849
Gosh, I really enjoyed it back then.

1043
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:44,639
As if. You always yelled while gaming

1044
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,459
and made me mess up my drawings.

1045
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:50,599
So? Did you not enjoy it?

1046
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:54,439
If you didn't like it, you should have gone somewhere else to draw. Why were you always by my side?

1047
01:19:54,439 --> 01:19:58,809
Well, it became quiet shortly after since you always fell asleep.

1048
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,739
It was tolerable.

1049
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:06,039
Do you think I wouldn't know?

1050
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:07,689
Know what?

1051
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:09,399
When I fell asleep after gaming,

1052
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:12,029
you would stare at me intently.

1053
01:20:14,599 --> 01:20:18,239
What are you saying? Why would I do that?

1054
01:20:19,919 --> 01:20:25,399
Aigo, how cute. Just cute. You're honestly too cute.

1055
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:28,539
Okay, I closed my eyes. Look at me all you want.

1056
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:30,869
Do whatever you want.

1057
01:20:40,219 --> 01:20:42,319
Look at you.

1058
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:43,709
- You said I could.
- Come here.

1059
01:20:43,709 --> 01:20:45,869
Come here. How could you suddenly kiss me out of nowhere?

1060
01:20:45,869 --> 01:20:48,439
Forgive me this once.

1061
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,969
Come here. Seriously.

1062
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,319
- Come here.
- It tickles.

1063
01:21:08,049 --> 01:21:09,569
Hey.

1064
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:11,979
Who's the one who gave me a hard time being tactless?

1065
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:15,849
- Let go. What the heck?
- Don't interrupt them.

1066
01:21:15,849 --> 01:21:19,959
That's Ian's match Jamie has been talking about.

1067
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,299
Match?

1068
01:21:21,299 --> 01:21:23,889
Yes, match.

1069
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:27,329
This is the blind date set in motion when Ian entered the company. Did you not know about it?

1070
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:30,269
Jamie's long-term project.

1071
01:21:30,269 --> 01:21:34,529
So don't interrupt them and let's eat something delicious together.

1072
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,179
Gosh! Let go of me.

1073
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:38,429
What's wrong with you?

1074
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:41,299
What have you been looking at? Let me see it.

1075
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:43,549
What's this?

1076
01:21:43,549 --> 01:21:45,809
- Let go.
- Let's go and eat.

1077
01:21:45,809 --> 01:21:47,459
Let's go.

1078
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,539
Aren't you hungry, Eddy? How could you not take a single bite?

1079
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:58,879
Thanks to you, I ate two bowls. I fail at my diet.

1080
01:21:58,879 --> 01:22:01,279
Did you two have a good lunch?

1081
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:03,329
Did you two have fun?

1082
01:22:03,329 --> 01:22:04,639
It's a secret!

1083
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,079
You two are late.

1084
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,059
- Oh, that's because Jamie-
- Today's late night coffee...

1085
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:14,889
- Isn't it on Jamie this time?
- Oh, is it?

1086
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:17,109
See you.

1087
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:20,569
But it'll be hard for Jamie to carry everything by herself.

1088
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,529
Right?

1089
01:22:22,529 --> 01:22:25,839
Jamie, wait up! I think I should go, too.

1090
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:35,219
Hey, what was that? From earlier.

1091
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:38,519
What? Oh, that?

1092
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:41,729
Jamie's friend is a fan of mine,

1093
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:44,099
so she introduced us.

1094
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:48,729
So that was a fan meeting? Not a blind date?

1095
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:50,639
Yes.

1096
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,529
What's up? Why are you so angry?

1097
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:55,249
Are you jealous?

1098
01:22:55,249 --> 01:22:56,869
Yes, I'm jealous.

1099
01:22:56,869 --> 01:23:01,159
How could I not be when my boyfriend went on a blind date?

1100
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:04,019
Oh, boyfriend...

1101
01:23:04,019 --> 01:23:06,169
You are.

1102
01:23:06,169 --> 01:23:08,029
What if someone sees us at work? Come on.

1103
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:10,489
- Who cares?
- Stop.

1104
01:23:12,209 --> 01:23:15,050
Hey, it hurts!

1105
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,609
It hurts.

1106
01:23:18,609 --> 01:23:20,529
It hurts.

1107
01:23:22,139 --> 01:23:24,929
Sunny, did you enjoy your lunch?

1108
01:23:24,929 --> 01:23:26,909
You two are very affectionate these days.

1109
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:30,969
Oh, ever since we went for round two after the company dinner...

1110
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,679
Yes, the company dinner.

1111
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,599
Good for you.

1112
01:23:42,529 --> 01:23:45,009
You're too careless.

1113
01:23:45,009 --> 01:23:48,289
Why, why? What? Who'll say anything about us dating?

1114
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,229
Bring them to me.

1115
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:52,239
Don't you know what will happen if we're caught?

1116
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,399
Who cares?

1117
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:57,149
Well, soon I won't be here anymore-

1118
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:05,869
I see. There's no reason for Wan to come back.

1119
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:07,589
It was like that.

1120
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:11,279
I'm not saying we'll break up.

1121
01:24:12,959 --> 01:24:15,629
Come on, be more careful. We're at work.

1122
01:24:15,629 --> 01:24:17,609
Don't say things like that.

1123
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,709
We went through so much to reunite.

1124
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:23,559
Sorry.

1125
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,639
If you're sorry, do better.

1126
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:28,449
If you're sorry, don't run away from now on.

1127
01:24:28,449 --> 01:24:30,509
I won't.

1128
01:24:30,509 --> 01:24:33,059
And don't smile like that in front of anyone else.

1129
01:24:33,059 --> 01:24:37,319
Tell her no, straightforwardly, if Jamie says she'll set you up on a blind date. Do you understand?

1130
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:40,229
What's this? Are you still jealous?

1131
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:43,209
One more thing. Don't wear such cute clothes to work.

1132
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:47,449
I hate other people looking at my favorite outfit of yours.

1133
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:51,479
Oh, are you controlling your boyfriend now?

1134
01:24:51,479 --> 01:24:53,089
Good, good.

1135
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:56,669
You...

1136
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:59,589
What is it?

1137
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,389
What do you think?

1138
01:25:03,419 --> 01:25:05,759
You thought I'd hold your hand, but I was going for a hug.

1139
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:08,439
- Someone's going to come and see us.
- Who would come here? No one will.

1140
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:09,879
They're here. They're here.

1141
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,959
- I won't fall for it. Three minutes.
- No.

1142
01:25:11,959 --> 01:25:15,749
Then just for one minute. Let's just stay like this. No one will come-

1143
01:25:15,749 --> 01:25:18,189
- Oh, I got a text.
- Don't lie.

1144
01:25:18,189 --> 01:25:22,349
For real. Look. I'm going to check my text.

1145
01:25:22,349 --> 01:25:25,339
- One minute.
- One minute.

1146
01:25:25,339 --> 01:25:26,999
Hurry back.

1147
01:25:38,329 --> 01:25:40,669
[010-432-1763]

1148
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:44,819
This is PD Ahn. My number has changed.

1149
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:48,599
I'd like to make a proposal. Can we meet?

1150
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,285
Where are these guys?

1151
01:26:01,285 --> 01:26:03,855
They are all busy, Punk. You're the only one who's not.

1152
01:26:03,855 --> 01:26:06,155
I'm busy, too!

1153
01:26:06,155 --> 01:26:08,415
- In my own way.
- Hey, it's been a while.

1154
01:26:08,415 --> 01:26:10,965
- Hey, you're here!
- It's been a while.

1155
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:13,165
- How have you been?
- Do you know what time it is?

1156
01:26:13,165 --> 01:26:16,485
- Sorry, sorry.
- Whatever. Let's drink.

1157
01:26:18,495 --> 01:26:20,145
Look at you.

1158
01:26:20,145 --> 01:26:22,795
If someone saw you right now, they would think you drank 3 liters of beer yourself.

1159
01:26:22,795 --> 01:26:24,865
- What?
- Nothing. I'm not talking about you.

1160
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:26,695
Our Jin Seok can just keep eating.

1161
01:26:26,695 --> 01:26:28,065
Thanks.

1162
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:30,125
How did you reunite with Wan?

1163
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,415
- He works at my company.
- What?

1164
01:26:32,415 --> 01:26:35,985
Hey! What has he been up to?

1165
01:26:35,985 --> 01:26:40,145
He disappeared without leaving a trace of whether he was alive or not.

1166
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:42,085
You searched everywhere for him.

1167
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:45,165
When did I? It wasn't to that extent.

1168
01:26:45,165 --> 01:26:46,465
Yes, it was.

1169
01:26:46,465 --> 01:26:50,032
Hey, didn't we make a bet at the time?

1170
01:26:50,032 --> 01:26:52,792
I bet he went to study abroad. Han Kyeong Wu-

1171
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,602
I bet he'd enrolled in a boarding school.

1172
01:26:55,602 --> 01:26:59,652
He just went back to Daejeon and joined the military...

1173
01:26:59,652 --> 01:27:02,712
His sister runs a restaurant. He helped her and such.

1174
01:27:02,712 --> 01:27:06,212
Wow. I can't believe he was still in the country.

1175
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:09,402
But we still couldn't find him. That sneaky bastard.

1176
01:27:09,402 --> 01:27:13,772
That sneaky bastard. No one won the bet because of him.

1177
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:15,062
Geez.

1178
01:27:15,062 --> 01:27:17,052
Is that really important right now?

1179
01:27:17,052 --> 01:27:20,682
I find these things important.

1180
01:27:20,682 --> 01:27:22,612
How is he after all these years?

1181
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,754
Nothing changed. He's just the same as before.

1182
01:27:24,754 --> 01:27:26,354
I'm a bit bummed.

1183
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:30,074
I thought he'd appear after debuting

1184
01:27:30,074 --> 01:27:34,684
or appear with cute children in tow. That's what I imagined.

1185
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:36,124
What?

1186
01:27:36,124 --> 01:27:37,814
Your imagination knows no boundaries.

1187
01:27:37,814 --> 01:27:41,094
Why? What? What's wrong with that?

1188
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:46,034
But... why did he suddenly disappear?

1189
01:27:46,034 --> 01:27:47,144
What?

1190
01:27:47,144 --> 01:27:52,664
I mean... I'm curious about why he suddenly vanished.

1191
01:27:52,664 --> 01:27:54,074
What could it be?

1192
01:27:54,074 --> 01:27:57,614
Hey, whatever the reason, he disappeared without a word.

1193
01:27:57,614 --> 01:27:59,914
Remember how much Gi Tae suffered?

1194
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:02,264
That was really mean of him.

1195
01:28:02,264 --> 01:28:05,144
- Forget it. Let's raise our glasses.
- Sounds good.

1196
01:28:05,144 --> 01:28:06,634
Cheers.

1197
01:28:07,884 --> 01:28:09,874
From some point,

1198
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:13,234
- I began to feign nonchalance.
- No one's going home. We are partying all night.

1199
01:28:13,234 --> 01:28:16,184
- If I talked about that time,
- I don't think I can.

1200
01:28:16,184 --> 01:28:18,394
- I was afraid he might disappear again.
- I have to go soon.

1201
01:28:18,394 --> 01:28:20,354
Do you have a lover or something?

1202
01:28:20,354 --> 01:28:21,724
I intentionally feigned ignorance.

1203
01:28:21,724 --> 01:28:24,114
Who would like this guy?

1204
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,530
It's been a while. Have you been well?

1205
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:32,060
Yes, I didn't think I'd see you again.

1206
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,650
I knew we'd meet again.

1207
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:38,420
You took an illustrator job at the Re:Try game company.

1208
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,080
They reached out to me not long after our meeting.

1209
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,950
I see.

1210
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,720
The word about you has already spread on our end.

1211
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,900
As expected, you were too good to let go.

1212
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,870
Gosh, no.

1213
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:52,940
It's my coworkers who are great.

1214
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,040
Wan...

1215
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,730
It looks like you're ready to draw other drawings.

1216
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,920
The thing about timing is quite mysterious.

1217
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,450
After parting with you at the final interview,

1218
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,010
three other rookie artists were chosen.

1219
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:12,680
As we were preparing to leave,

1220
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,880
one of the artists suddenly said they couldn't go.

1221
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,900
So I asked them why they couldn't and

1222
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,800
he said he didn't know why he was drawing and wanted to find the reason. Gosh.

1223
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,430
But...

1224
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,310
for us to continue with two people...

1225
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,160
We do have a contract to uphold, so...

1226
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,180
it's been postponed.

1227
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,270
Then I took a look at your illustrations and

1228
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,980
noted your skills improved exponentially.

1229
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,990
Let's go to the camp together.

1230
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:52,370
We're going to start in Australia next month, Artist Lee.

1231
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:54,680
We are going to assign a professional to you for the storyline.

1232
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,433
I'm...

1233
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,720
very grateful, but I'm working on a project

1234
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,900
Aren't you leaving once the app launches?

1235
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,170
Why are you hesitating? You have to take this chance.

1236
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:12,170
What you're doing right now is like a stepping stone, Wan.

1237
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,780
It's not your final destination.

1238
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,960
Don't tell me...

1239
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,940
Leaving to search for your reason for drawing is forbidden.

1240
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:24,920
I have become neurotic about that now.

1241
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:32,130
Then... let's meet again in a couple of days.

1242
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:36,570
For me to explain the curriculum to you and to grow closer,

1243
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:38,480
and for a drink.

1244
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,370
All right then.

1245
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:58,760
That looks so fun.

1246
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,160
Oh...

1247
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,550
By the way, what's with those plants?

1248
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:08,200
I have been curious for a while.

1249
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,040
Oh, they are my hobby.

1250
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,030
It really doesn't suit you.

1251
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,980
Why not?

1252
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,130
I water them every morning and night at nine o'clock,

1253
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:21,230
wipe the leaves here and there,

1254
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:24,000
and check their condition on the weekends.

1255
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,040
You should try it, too. It's really fun.

1256
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,450
I just...

1257
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:34,970
feel oddly at ease while looking at them.

1258
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:40,000
They don't go anywhere and take root where they stand.

1259
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,878
Your words have a hidden meaning.

1260
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:45,468
If you understand, then please don't go anywhere.

1261
01:31:45,468 --> 01:31:48,128
I'm not going anywhere.

1262
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,590
So noisy.

1263
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:02,410
It's always a choice between two things.

1264
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:04,260
Gosh, my head hurts.

1265
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:07,480
Isn't it so hard to make a choice?

1266
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,960
My head is about split because I can't decide if I should make

1267
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,010
the "select" button round or triangular.

1268
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:18,500
Why? My heart is fluttering from developing a dating game.

1269
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,570
Wait, wait. Are you dating someone?

1270
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:23,490
- Wow.
- Gosh, I feel so betrayed.

1271
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:25,220
No way.

1272
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,670
He's always working into the night at the office.

1273
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:31,400
When would he have the time? I say it's impossible.

1274
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,120
Impossible?

1275
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:36,180
Wait, it's true?

1276
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:38,990
Yeah, right...

1277
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,840
How could someone like Eddy date anyone?

1278
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,670
Don't you think so, Sunny? Do you like his type?

1279
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,480
CEO, let's go, please.

1280
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,890
- Shall we go to our company dinner?
- Wait, what's wrong with me?

1281
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,840
Artist Lee! Over here.

1282
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:59,040
Oh, hello.

1283
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,580
Why did you come here?

1284
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,280
Well, you don't have a car.

1285
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,370
It seemed like quite a walk after riding the bus, so

1286
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,190
I came to escort you.

1287
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,440
- And who might you be?
- He must be a colleague.

1288
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,500
- Yes, yes.
- Hello, I'm...

1289
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,230
He's a producer I know from before.

1290
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,830
I'm leaving first. I'll see you later.

1291
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:22,560
Okay. Bye.

1292
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,350
When are you coming?

1293
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:43,080
Hey, why are you so late?

1294
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,610
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1295
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:48,590
Are you okay? Be careful.

1296
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:52,310
Have you been drinking all this time?

1297
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:54,720
Hey, get it together.

1298
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,510
Lie down properly.

1299
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:03,950
Whoa, it's my handsome boyfriend.

1300
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:06,990
Are you happy leaving your boyfriend to go drinking?

1301
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:08,880
Who was that?

1302
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,030
It reeks of alcohol, gosh.

1303
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:14,870
It's coming from you.

1304
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:16,370
Does it?

1305
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:19,990
I will deal with you when you wake up.

1306
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:23,790
Gi Tae.

1307
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:26,330
Why? What? Do you want water?

1308
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:28,870
Or do you need to go to the bathroom?

1309
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,480
You wouldn't want me going somewhere else, right?

1310
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,840
What?

1311
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,520
What I mean is... if I leave for somewhere...

1312
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:43,080
What are you talking about?

1313
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,080
Wan. Hey, Lee Wan.

1314
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:57,140
The anxiety I had been ignoring all this time

1315
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,650
has come back to taunt me.

1316
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,340
Are you up? Have a seat.

1317
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,310
You need to cure that hangover.

1318
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,050
What did you do last night?

1319
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,960
What? Oh, well...

1320
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,700
I never meant to get that drunk.

1321
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,930
I'm sorry.

1322
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:46,640
Not that.

1323
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,010
Then what? Did I make a mistake?

1324
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,620
What did you mean about going somewhere else?

1325
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:01,020
Where would I go?

1326
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,210
Wan...

1327
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,440
I'm scared.

1328
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:12,480
What?

1329
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:18,370
I'm scared you'll disappear before my eyes again.

1330
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,720
Hey, it's not like that.

1331
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,810
Then what did you mean last night?

1332
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:31,220
Was that just drunk talk then?

1333
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:38,280
You can't say anything.

1334
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,430
It's fine if you don't tell me right now

1335
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:47,250
since the answer is set.

1336
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:51,910
You can't leave me this time.

1337
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:56,810
You can't run away. I will make it that way.

1338
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:25,600
If I could, when should I turn back time to?

1339
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:33,590
We might be feeling... the same sense of anxiety.

1340
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,410
I'm sorry for cornering you. Let's talk.

1341
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,720
I can't even reach him.
[Wan]

1342
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:08,500
The call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to the voicemail.

1343
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,110
After the beep, there will be a charge for the call.

1344
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,610
Hey, Lee Wan!

1345
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,460
Hey, Wan!

1346
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,760
Well, sorry.

1347
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,880
I'll be off.

1348
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:44,300
Wan!

1349
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:47,180
Lee Wan!

1350
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,980
Wan!

1351
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:56,850
Lee Wan! Wan... Lee Wan!

1352
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,850
Wan!

1353
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,820
Lee Wan!

1354
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:14,070
Wan! Lee Wan!

1355
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:26,520
Hey.

1356
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:33,440
Hey. Where have you been all this time?

1357
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,800
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

1358
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,060
Once again, I thought you...

1359
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:45,810
Something came up at Nuna's restaurant.

1360
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,050
You disappeared,

1361
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,410
but I didn't know where you might be.

1362
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:55,200
It was the same as seven years ago.

1363
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,480
I'm such an idiot...

1364
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:00,640
Sorry...

1365
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,980
I told you. I'm scared, Wan.

1366
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:11,220
I'm so scared you might disappear before my eyes.

1367
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:15,960
Sorry...

1368
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:36,620
Gi Tae.

1369
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:47,460
I just... feel oddly at ease while looking at them.

1370
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:52,480
They don't go anywhere and take root where they stand.

1371
01:41:04,994 --> 01:41:07,964
All right. There are two days left before the launch.

1372
01:41:07,964 --> 01:41:11,124
We will hold our last meeting today. Please gather in the meeting room in an hour, everyone.

1373
01:41:11,124 --> 01:41:14,464
Oh, Theo. Eddy's not here yet.

1374
01:41:14,464 --> 01:41:17,484
Eddy is not coming because he has a business to attend to.

1375
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:27,194
Are you not coming to work today?

1376
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:37,454
[Did you take time off?]

1377
01:41:42,754 --> 01:41:45,294
He didn't even call me.

1378
01:41:45,294 --> 01:41:47,204
He's making me nervous.

1379
01:41:59,884 --> 01:42:01,624
- Ian.
- Yes?

1380
01:42:01,624 --> 01:42:03,354
There's something I'm curious about.

1381
01:42:03,354 --> 01:42:05,064
Go ahead.

1382
01:42:05,064 --> 01:42:08,114
Why did you start drawing?

1383
01:42:08,114 --> 01:42:10,114
Well...

1384
01:42:13,442 --> 01:42:17,392
What's with you, Sunny? Asking him out of the blue?

1385
01:42:17,392 --> 01:42:21,692
Are you curious after the project is almost finished?

1386
01:42:21,692 --> 01:42:26,042
I guess you wouldn't understand an artist's heart, my cold-hearted planner.

1387
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:30,362
CEO, be quiet. I asked Ian.

1388
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:33,862
I guess, now that I think about it,

1389
01:42:33,862 --> 01:42:38,122
did I ask you this question at your interview?

1390
01:42:38,122 --> 01:42:41,912
Ian, why did you start drawing?

1391
01:42:42,832 --> 01:42:45,292
Why...

1392
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:50,422
Whoa! What's this?

1393
01:42:51,622 --> 01:42:54,462
This is practically a relic.

1394
01:42:54,462 --> 01:42:57,402
When did you start drawing this?

1395
01:42:57,402 --> 01:42:59,002
In high school.

1396
01:42:59,002 --> 01:43:01,192
I see...

1397
01:43:01,192 --> 01:43:06,522
Wow! But the faces all look the same.

1398
01:43:06,522 --> 01:43:09,602
I don't think this is a self-portrait.

1399
01:43:09,602 --> 01:43:12,842
That's right. This is a real artist.

1400
01:43:12,842 --> 01:43:15,742
Sunny. Did you know being an artist requires originality-

1401
01:43:15,742 --> 01:43:17,692
CEO, aren't you busy?

1402
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,372
I am.

1403
01:43:25,252 --> 01:43:27,952
I can tell just from the drawing...

1404
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,932
the reason you started drawing.

1405
01:43:37,072 --> 01:43:42,622
The reason why I draw... it's because...

1406
01:43:46,032 --> 01:43:50,172
of him... Shin Gi Tae.

1407
01:43:56,592 --> 01:43:59,052
- Ian, where are you going?
- I'm taking a half day off.

1408
01:43:59,052 --> 01:44:00,342
I have to go somewhere.

1409
01:44:00,342 --> 01:44:02,462
[Magic Toon Business Center]

1410
01:44:02,462 --> 01:44:05,472
Are you sure you won't regret this?

1411
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:08,182
Yes.

1412
01:44:08,182 --> 01:44:12,102
Wan, I don't think you understand what kind of opportunity this is.

1413
01:44:12,102 --> 01:44:13,952
Excuse me, PD.

1414
01:44:14,662 --> 01:44:17,592
I thought about why I started drawing after that day.

1415
01:44:17,592 --> 01:44:20,122
It's forbidden... Forbidden! Forbidden!

1416
01:44:20,122 --> 01:44:22,332
I told you not to have those thoughts.

1417
01:44:22,332 --> 01:44:25,602
I wasn't joking.

1418
01:44:26,432 --> 01:44:30,832
I have been drawing every night on a blog no one may see.

1419
01:44:30,832 --> 01:44:35,492
The reason I continued to draw, erase, and draw again,

1420
01:44:35,492 --> 01:44:38,322
was because I wanted to show it to someone.

1421
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:41,682
I drew these pictures hoping that person

1422
01:44:41,682 --> 01:44:45,552
- would eventually see them.
- Sorry?

1423
01:44:45,552 --> 01:44:48,782
My drawing would have no meaning if it weren't for that person.

1424
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:50,632
That still holds true to this day.

1425
01:44:51,892 --> 01:44:55,612
You really won't regret this, will you? I won't ask again.

1426
01:44:58,172 --> 01:45:00,830
Yes, I won't.

1427
01:45:01,402 --> 01:45:05,372
Even if I do, this is the right choice.

1428
01:45:06,242 --> 01:45:08,002
I'm sorry.

1429
01:45:12,132 --> 01:45:15,612
Where are you? Let's meet up and talk-

1430
01:45:16,432 --> 01:45:18,082
I'm right here.

1431
01:45:18,082 --> 01:45:21,332
Hey, what the heck? I couldn't reach you all day.

1432
01:45:21,332 --> 01:45:23,892
I had to go on an urgent business trip this morning.

1433
01:45:23,892 --> 01:45:25,952
Didn't Theo tell you?

1434
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:29,832
He didn't. He just said you weren't coming.

1435
01:45:29,832 --> 01:45:32,772
Was it because it's still confidential?

1436
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:34,842
Anyhow, why are you here?

1437
01:45:35,592 --> 01:45:37,052
Me?

1438
01:45:38,542 --> 01:45:40,742
Why am I here? Where is this?

1439
01:45:40,742 --> 01:45:44,602
What the heck? What's wrong with you? You're being weird-

1440
01:45:44,602 --> 01:45:46,452
What the heck?

1441
01:45:46,452 --> 01:45:47,762
Let's go home.

1442
01:45:47,762 --> 01:45:49,712
What are you going to do at home?

1443
01:45:49,712 --> 01:45:52,072
Let's eat tteokbokki.

1444
01:45:52,072 --> 01:45:55,682
Tteokbokki? Let's go.

1445
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:58,232
By the way, you know tomorrow is my birthday, right?

1446
01:45:58,232 --> 01:46:00,162
Of course, I do.

1447
01:46:00,162 --> 01:46:02,292
What about a gift?

1448
01:46:02,292 --> 01:46:05,182
I already have it prepared.

1449
01:46:06,372 --> 01:46:08,502
Hurry!

1450
01:46:08,502 --> 01:46:10,562
Okay.

1451
01:46:28,442 --> 01:46:30,242
Hello?

1452
01:46:30,242 --> 01:46:34,262
There are two minutes left until my birthday. Where is my gift?

1453
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:36,852
It's not midnight yet.

1454
01:46:36,852 --> 01:46:40,142
One minute, fifty-nine, fifty-eight...

1455
01:46:40,142 --> 01:46:43,742
- Five, four, three, two...
- Go to my blog.

1456
01:46:43,742 --> 01:46:45,642
- Your blog?
- Yes.

1457
01:46:45,642 --> 01:46:48,982
A post visible to only you will appear at midnight.

1458
01:46:48,982 --> 01:46:52,102
Okay! I'm going to check it right away.

1459
01:46:56,829 --> 01:47:01,549
We graduated, and I told him I liked him.

1460
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:04,572
Tomorrow is my enlistment day.

1461
01:47:05,262 --> 01:47:09,662
I hope I can forget everything and start anew when I return.

1462
01:47:12,322 --> 01:47:17,142
I coincidentally... heard his name while working.

1463
01:47:18,012 --> 01:47:20,612
I thought I had forgotten about him by now.

1464
01:47:22,402 --> 01:47:24,982
My aunt passed away.

1465
01:47:29,132 --> 01:47:32,222
As expected, I couldn't contact him.

1466
01:47:36,662 --> 01:47:39,712
I thought I would never see him again.

1467
01:47:39,712 --> 01:47:43,292
But I coincidentally met him again today.

1468
01:47:44,282 --> 01:47:46,792
Happy birthday.

1469
01:47:46,792 --> 01:47:48,692
This is...

1470
01:47:48,692 --> 01:47:53,162
my record of the time when you weren't there.

1471
01:47:55,742 --> 01:47:59,172
[Gameboy: I love the person you were...]

1472
01:48:13,744 --> 01:48:18,614
I love the person you were when I wasn't there.

1473
01:48:22,322 --> 01:48:23,522
[Gi Tae]

1474
01:48:29,442 --> 01:48:30,992
Gi Tae.

1475
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:35,392
Come out for a second.

1476
01:48:35,392 --> 01:48:37,532
Nothing really changed here.

1477
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:40,092
It's always tiring to come here.

1478
01:48:40,092 --> 01:48:42,402
We're almost there.

1479
01:48:42,992 --> 01:48:46,302
But do you think the rooftop door will be open?

1480
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:51,522
They leave it unlocked, just as always.

1481
01:48:51,522 --> 01:48:53,022
Why did we come here?

1482
01:48:53,022 --> 01:48:54,792
Come on.

1483
01:49:05,722 --> 01:49:08,322
I have something to tell you.

1484
01:49:12,442 --> 01:49:15,292
What is it? I'm nervous.

1485
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:21,102
There's something I need to tell you again, even though I have said it before.

1486
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:29,662
I like you.

1487
01:49:31,312 --> 01:49:33,212
I like you.

1488
01:49:35,002 --> 01:49:38,822
I know the outcome of this story. Here on this rooftop...

1489
01:49:39,702 --> 01:49:42,612
I like you, too.

1490
01:49:44,382 --> 01:49:46,172
What I meant was...

1491
01:49:48,122 --> 01:49:53,002
The way I like you... is in this way.

1492
01:49:59,322 --> 01:50:01,642
So what's your response?

1493
01:50:07,002 --> 01:50:10,772
So... my response is...

1494
01:50:33,882 --> 01:50:37,972
I won't run away again. Ever.

1495
01:50:37,972 --> 01:50:39,632
I mean it.

1496
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:47,990
team credit

1497
01:50:57,642 --> 01:50:58,782
Wow.

1498
01:50:58,782 --> 01:51:01,382
Gosh, we screwed up.

1499
01:51:02,642 --> 01:51:06,532
This is why I told you someone should be on the lookout.

1500
01:51:06,532 --> 01:51:08,712
Geez, nothing ever goes right.

1501
01:51:08,712 --> 01:51:12,772
I mean, what will we do if Ian leaves like this? Nothing will run properly.

1502
01:51:12,772 --> 01:51:14,362
- Well?
- He wasn't here before.

1503
01:51:14,362 --> 01:51:16,702
There's something I'd like to congratulate you on.

1504
01:51:16,702 --> 01:51:18,332
What is it?

1505
01:51:18,332 --> 01:51:22,042
As you all know, I used to draw cartoons.

1506
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:26,502
Recently, I received an official serial request from a webtoon platform. So...

1507
01:51:26,502 --> 01:51:28,782
I'm being given a chance to debut as an artist.

1508
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:32,342
Whoa, really? That's great news!

1509
01:51:32,342 --> 01:51:37,612
But it was on the condition that I work abroad.

1510
01:51:37,612 --> 01:51:39,962
So I rejected them.

1511
01:51:40,732 --> 01:51:42,992
Isn't this chance hard to come by again?

1512
01:51:42,992 --> 01:51:46,652
It is. I think it's a great opportunity for you. Are you okay?

1513
01:51:46,652 --> 01:51:50,492
But... they contacted me again yesterday.

1514
01:51:50,492 --> 01:51:52,962
They want to make our game into a webtoon.

1515
01:51:52,962 --> 01:51:55,842
Webtoons are easily accessible, which will help us promote.

1516
01:51:55,842 --> 01:51:59,052
And I think it will also be great for expanding the story of our game.

1517
01:51:59,052 --> 01:52:01,892
- What do you think?
- I'm all for it!

1518
01:52:01,892 --> 01:52:05,832
Truth be told, I've been trying to make contact with the webtoon field.

1519
01:52:05,832 --> 01:52:08,652
Did the platform give us the okay?

1520
01:52:08,652 --> 01:52:12,902
Yes, we can fine-tune the details if everyone is all right with this.

1521
01:52:12,902 --> 01:52:14,932
And we were the ones to receive the offer first.

1522
01:52:14,932 --> 01:52:16,712
This is really great.

1523
01:52:16,712 --> 01:52:19,382
Eddy, our schedule can allow this, right?

1524
01:52:19,382 --> 01:52:23,032
We would have to make it work, even if it didn't. I'll check.

1525
01:52:23,032 --> 01:52:26,502
Okay. Then we have agreed to proceed with this, right?

1526
01:52:26,502 --> 01:52:28,132
Let me know when everything is settled

1527
01:52:28,132 --> 01:52:30,592
and share the changes in the schedule as they're made, okay?

1528
01:52:30,592 --> 01:52:34,332
- Yes.
- How about a high-five? High-five.

1529
01:52:34,332 --> 01:52:36,272
High-five?

1530
01:52:36,272 --> 01:52:38,452
Jamie can't beat me. One more time?

1531
01:52:38,452 --> 01:52:39,552
Please stop, CEO.

1532
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:41,852
Should I? Let's have some cake then.

1533
01:52:41,852 --> 01:52:44,622
- Knife. Where's the knife?
- Do I really have to go?

1534
01:52:44,622 --> 01:52:46,292
Just eat it like this.

Aigo. Wan, wake up.

1537
01:52:59,612 --> 01:53:01,802
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.

1538
01:53:01,802 --> 01:53:03,982
Wake up.

1539
01:53:04,672 --> 01:53:07,322
All right, I'm awake.

1540
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:10,282
Hurry and wake up. Tomorrow's your deadline.

1541
01:53:10,282 --> 01:53:13,552
I made breakfast, so make sure to eat.

1542
01:53:13,552 --> 01:53:16,382
All right. Get to work.

1543

Your hyeongnim is going to work...

1544
01:53:19,442 --> 01:53:22,062
Don't I get a kiss?

1545
01:53:22,062 --> 01:53:25,902
Hyeongnim, my foot. My birthday is sooner.

1546
01:53:25,902 --> 01:53:27,632
Kiss me.

1547
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:33,852
Do you really want to do this first thing in the morning?

1548
01:53:36,482 --> 01:53:39,732
I should really get going now. I'm leaving.

1549
01:53:39,732 --> 01:53:41,672
Take care.

1550
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:56,092
Now, what? Should I not go?

1551
01:53:56,092 --> 01:53:58,212
Yes. Don't go.

1552
01:53:58,212 --> 01:53:59,552
Really?

1553
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,132
Yes.

1554
01:54:01,132 --> 01:54:03,172
Really?

1555
01:54:04,252 --> 01:54:06,182
Get there safely.

1556
01:54:07,832 --> 01:54:10,752
I'm leaving. Just wait for me a bit.

1557
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:26,682
Is this a happily ever after?

1558
01:54:26,682 --> 01:54:28,932
I'm not really sure.

1559
01:54:28,932 --> 01:54:33,592
We are happy now, but it could be game over anytime.

1560
01:54:33,592 --> 01:54:36,552
But one thing I'm sure of

1561
01:54:36,552 --> 01:54:39,102
in this long game called life,

1562
01:54:39,102 --> 01:54:41,702
is that the simulations will continue,

1563
01:54:41,702 --> 01:54:45,722
and I'll choose love instead of running away.

1564
01:54:45,722 --> 01:54:48,162
How do I know this?

1565
01:54:48,162 --> 01:54:50,510
Because I have done it once before.
