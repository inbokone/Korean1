- What time is it?
- Get some more sleep.

<i>Honey bunny, I'm your raccoon</i>

<i>Shake away</i>
<i>Let's have some fun</i>

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,529
<i>And look cool</i>

00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,667
Hey, you.

8
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,794
Two <i>geun</i> of pork shoulder, right?

9
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,588
Actually, three <i>geun</i> of belly.
Top-quality pork belly.

00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,674
Your son must make
a lot of money these days.

11
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,927
- Someone's become a big spender.
- How could I spend his money?

12
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,848
I keep telling him to save his money
but he won't listen to me.

13
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,183
Hey, have you heard of the Gold Resort?

14
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,894
It costs a million won a night
to stay there.

15
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,398
He kept insisting we go and stay there.
Gosh, he kills me.

16
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,941
Must be nice.

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,578
Hey, Son.

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,829
Oh, Mom.

19
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,707
- It's not heavy.
- Give it to me.

20
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,709
- It is heavy. Let go.
- No, it's not.

21
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,170
- Coming from the bathhouse?
- Yes.

22
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,589
You're glowing, Son.

23
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,925
We should eat out occasionally.
This is heavy.

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,178
Why should we eat out?
The food I make tastes so much better.

25
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,222
I don't want you to work so much.

26
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,642
You've changed.

27
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,440
- Ki-baek.
- Yes?

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,777
You know the singing school
where I go sell my products, right?

29
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,778
Yeah.

30
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
There's someone named Ms. Park.

31
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,575
She always buys
a lot of skincare products from me.

32
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:26,623
Ms. Park asked me if it'd be possible
to invite you to the class.

33
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,127
I told her, "My son is busy.
He doesn't have time to come here."

34
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,378
I told her that, but…

35
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,005
- Sure. I'll be there.
- What?

36
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,674
Oh, really?

37
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,385
Let me know the date and time.
I can't sing though.

38
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,012
Don't you worry about that.

39
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:45,475
The moment you show up,
all the ladies there will faint.

40
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,061
I'll set a sales record that day.

41
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,688
Only if you sing.

42
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,190
What?

43
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,985
Instead of going there to sell
your products, you should sing too.

44
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,113
I'll sign you up for the class.

45
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,076
Hey, I have no time to sing.

46
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,161
Fine. I won't come.

47
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,293
Thanks, Son.

48
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,879
Let's go.

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,139
Watch out for cars.

50
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,957
Ki-baek.

51
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,887
Mom.

52
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>We performed surgery</i>
<i>for the external injuries,</i>

53
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,966
<i>but she'd lost a lot of blood,</i>

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,677
<i>so she's very unstable right now.</i>

55
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,680
<i>She might require additional</i>
<i>surgical procedures.</i>

56
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,227
At the moment, I can't guarantee
she'll regain consciousness.

57
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:06,449
<i>I suggest you and your family</i>
<i>prepare yourselves for the worst.</i>

58
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,048
Mom turned the steering wheel
toward herself.

59
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,343
That's why none of us got hurt.

60
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,013
Mom's the only one who got hurt.

61
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,349
Only Mom.

62
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,215
Mom's surgery went well,

63
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,218
so we just need to wait
for her to wake up.

64
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,222
Hey. Mom will be okay, right?

65
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,893
When will she wake up?

66
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,353
Soon.

67
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,815
She'll wake up soon.

68
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,695
Mom, what should we do?

69
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,757
MS. PARK FROM SINGING SCHOOL

EPISODE 11:
HONEY BUNNY AND THE RACCOON

71
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,513
Where is Jeong-heon?

72
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,267
{\an8}This is nuts. Seriously.

73
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,768
{\an8}Last night, he was at home--

74
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,562
{\an8}Last night? Are you kidding me?

75
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,981
{\an8}Hurry up and find Jeong-heon. Now!

76
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:02,899
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

77
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,026
Hyeong-taek.

78
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,821
Find him no matter what, or you're fired.
You got that?

79
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,739
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,457
- <i>I'm your raccoon</i>

<i>You're my adorable chubby chub chub</i>

85
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,970
You have to be confident when you sing.

86
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,474
I feel uncomfortable
because you keep staring at me.

87
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,811
More people will stare at you
at the singing competition.

88
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,191
My mom is making me do it.
She says I'm way too timid.

89
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,236
She said she'd buy me 50,000 won worth
of game items if I sang onstage.

90
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,237
Really?

91
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,947
I'm so jealous.

92
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,949
<i>Sparkle, sparkle</i>
<i>I see no one but you</i>

93
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,993
I hate it when people look at me.

94
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,537
It scares me.

95
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,704
I hear you.

96
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,125
As if the eyeballs staring at you
will pop out.

97
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,460
Doesn't it make you dizzy?

98
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,795
Yeah, totally.

99
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,261
By the way, why does the raccoon call
the bunny his soulmate?

100
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,015
Good question.

101
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,853
A bunny and a raccoon
don't sound like a compatible pair.

102
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,318
Anyway, I'm off. Good luck.

103
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,196
Hey, mister. Wait.

104
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,075
It'll take place downtown.
Will you come and watch?

105
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm a busy man.

106
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,954
Aren't you unemployed?

107
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,164
No, I'm not.

108
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668
My mom told me every man sitting out here
during the day was jobless.

109
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,794
Really?

110
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,337
Man.

111
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,300
Well, sorry. I don't like that song.

112
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,969
Wait, mister!

113
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,429
Don't follow me.

114
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,148
Go and do what you need to do.

115
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,442
I'll be here.

116
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,614
The visiting hours are set.

117
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,824
You can't see her
even if you sit here all day.

118
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,125
You should go home and get changed.

119
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,171
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

120
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,898
Mr. Song?

121
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,067
Oh, Dr. Kim.

122
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,740
You must be in shock.

123
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,325
Your whole family, in fact.

124
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,326
Yes.

125
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:06,499
I was so flustered
that I didn't realize you worked here.

126
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,466
When you work at a hospital,

127
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,928
you often see people cry.

128
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,899
Being sick is…

129
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,114
Well, it's really awful and sad.

130
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,619
Perhaps a hospital is a place

131
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,706
where you can witness
the greatest misfortunes unfold.

132
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,629
In the past, it was so bad
that it made me feel miserable.

133
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,633
But you know what?

134
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,096
We cry when we're sad, but there's also
a thing called happy tears.

135
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:08,602
I meet people who cry the happiest tears.

136
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,646
Yu-jin has fully recovered.

137
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,898
Right here, at this hospital.

138
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,442
Thank you.

139
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:19,572
The kind of tears
you'll never forget until the day you die,

140
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,990
after seeing it just once.

141
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,996
This is a place
where such things can happen,

142
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,626
so save your tears for later,
no matter what kind of tears they are.

143
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,380
Okay.

144
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,527
Ki-baek, are you all right?

145
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,209
I'm really okay. All right?

146
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,627
Don't worry too much.

147
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,340
Have you eaten yet?

148
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,343
Let's go eat.

149
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,304
Sorry, I have to go take care
of something at the office.

150
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,805
Who cares about work now?

151
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,350
I really am okay.

152
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,311
Let's go. I'll take you home.

153
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,529
Come in.

154
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,407
Yes, take a seat.

155
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,461

I LOVE NEWS!

158
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,930
For you, Ki-baek,
the more media exposure, the better,

159
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,723
whether it's as a panelist or a guest.

160

So I'm reaching out to every program
I can think of.

161
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,938
You probably haven't figured out

162
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,856
so take these and go through them.

163
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,318
Sure, I'll go through them.

164
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,824
Oh, I was wondering if I could get paid up
front or get the signing bonus in advance.

165
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,576
My family's in a bit of a situation.

166
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,911
Sure, I'll do my best.

167
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,082
But as you know,
it may not cover what you need.

168
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,085
That's okay. It'll really help me out.

169
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,219
Yesterday was the last episode of
<i>The Troubles of Ppong-sik's Family.</i>

170
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,894
It's Mom's and my favorite drama.

171
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,115
Ki-baek, have you seen the remote?

172
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,996
I'm stepping out for some air.

173
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,373
Do you not plan on reopening the gym?

174
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,793
You should reopen tomorrow.

175
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,172
And start chipping in
for household expenses this month.

176
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,299
All right.

177
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,508
You too, Pung-baek.

178
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,345
If you have time to watch TV,
clean the house.

179
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,763
What is this?

180
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,725
If you're going to keep missing school,
take a leave of absence or drop out.

181
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,144
Okay.

182
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,230
Mom's in the hospital,
and you're concerned about money?

183
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
Are you worried
you'll have to be the breadwinner?

184
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,903
Yeah. I refuse to coddle you two
like Mom did,

185
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,240
so you guys need to get your act together.

186
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,252
Here. My wife made a few side dishes.

187
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,171
Why do you keep coming to see me?

188
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,131
You already visited my mom
in the hospital.

189
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,883
Hey, here.

190
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,803
What's this?

191
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,639
As you already know,
I'm broke and shameless.

192
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,685
It's such a small amount that I can't even
suggest you use it for the hospital bill.

193
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,396
Buy her a steak dinner
when she regains consciousness.

194
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,607
I make more money than you.
I can't take this.

195
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,484
Hey. Just take it.

196
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,653
If you don't, I'll be mad at you.

197
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,738
And Sol will hate you.

198
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,865
Hey, I'm off.

199
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,283
Stay and eat with me.

200
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,786
Sol and my wife are waiting
for me at the hospital.

201
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,832
You should go home too.
Take good care of your dad and brothers.

202
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,460
Dealing with a family member in hospital
is draining, so look after yourself.

203
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm off.

204
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,630
Hey.

205
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,481
- Why are you only eating rice again?
- I can barely swallow.

206
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,358
I can just have some rice and soup.

207
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,362
You need to eat well to have the energy
to chat with your family when they visit.

208
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,950
My dear son, Heung-su.

209
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,037
Work is stressful, isn't it? Here, eat up.

210
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
No, no. Heung-su is full.

211
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,958
- You should eat, Mom.
- It's been a while.

212
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,335
Oh, yes. Hello.

213
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,087
You should eat during your lunch break.

214
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,049
It's all right. I can't even visit often.

215
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,719
Are you a new caregiver?

216
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,846
My gosh. You don't know who he is?

217
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,389
You watch TV every day.

218
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,266
Guess who I am.

219
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,977
- It's you!
- Yes.

220
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,812
You're Yu Jae-seok!

221
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,940
Yes, this protruding mouth.
You are Yu Jae-seok.

222
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,484
- No, he's not.
- He's Yu Jae-seok?

223
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,986
- You're not Yu Jae-seok?
- Then who is he?

224
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,282
The son of Mr. Kim,
who runs the first-floor snack shop!

225
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,451
You're Dong-gu. Right?

226
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,744
Yes, Dong-gu.

227
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,622
- He's Dong-gu.
- Dong-gu.

228
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
What's up? Did something break?

229
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,803
Come sit here.

230
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,762
What?

231
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,310
Have you eaten?

232
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,688
Have you been sleeping?

233
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,402
So you haven't been eating
or sleeping. My goodness.

234
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
Try and get some sleep here.

235
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,668
Starting tomorrow, I'll be very busy.

236
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,753
Don't overwork yourself.

237
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,882
I have to take on
as much work as possible.

238
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,137
We have to hold out and make ends meet
until my mom wakes up.

239
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,226
Come with me.

240
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,395
What?

241
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,024
My mom used to wash my hair

242
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,027
in the shampoo station like this,
from time to time.

243
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,782
I enjoyed the minty sensation
as she was massaging my scalp.

244
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,826
I always felt so refreshed after.

245
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,370
I like it too.

246
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,499
So I occasionally pestered
my mom to wash my hair

247
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,544
when I was feeling anxious or sad.

248
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,007
When your hair is soaked with warm water,

249
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,925
and you feel the pressure
of the fingertips

250
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,428
and the delicate foam
on your scalp and hair…

251
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,808
You fall asleep.

252
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,504
{\an8}DAWN DELIVERY

253
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,049
My goodness.

254
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,009
Mr. Song, you're here.

255
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,844
I brought the stuff.

256
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,012
There's quite a bit.

257
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,681
You probably don't want to get rid
of all this stuff.

258
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,849
Is this everything?

259
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,186
There's some left. It's about this much.
I couldn't fit them all.

260
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,312
I'll make another trip.

261
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,105
Let's take them inside.

262
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,148
Thank you.

263
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,901
Just count on me.
I'll take care of everything.

264
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,571
How's your wife? Is she all right?

265
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,866
I've been meaning to visit her
in the hospital.

266
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,330
Whoa, who's this pretty lady?

267
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,291
Did you have a chat with your boyfriend?

268
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,963
I wanted to comfort him,
but he told me not to worry.

269
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,089
He said he was okay.

270
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,757
The way he said it,

271
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,885
it made him sound invincible.

272
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,887
You believe that obvious lie?

273
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,056
He doesn't lie.

274
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,933
Everybody lies.

275
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,476
Trust me. He doesn't.

276
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,854
Fine, whatever.
I'm heading out to see my boyfriend.

277
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,819
What?

278
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,488
Did you call her?

279
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,951
God, you're such a wimp.

280
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,620
Who do you take after?

281
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,539
You, obviously.

282
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,624
Fine. Do whatever you want, wimp.

283
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,675
<i>The rose of Sharon has bloomed</i>

284
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,846
<i>The rose of Sharon has bloomed</i>

285
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,725
Here's yours, Gu-won.

286
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,442
Mom, can you open this for me?

287
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,359
Sure.

288
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,371
Hey, Gu-won. Are you still mad at me?

289
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,043
- Mom.
- Yeah?

290
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,170
Su-a and I broke up.

291
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,760
You did what?

292
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,181
Su-a likes Seong-bin more now.

293
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:34,603
So I told our teacher
that she betrayed me.

294
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,733
Gu-won. You're nine years old, right?

295
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,906
My teacher told me you can't control
your feelings when you like someone,

296
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,785
just like when you're hungry or sleepy.

297
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,204
That's probably how you feel too.

298
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,331
Because you like that guy.

299
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:06,134
Gu-won, you're my best output.

300
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,346
Output? What's that?

301
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,227
It means
you're the greatest gift of my life.

302
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,147
You know, he's no match for me.

303
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,398
Really?

304
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,068
You'll be my mom forever,

305
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,905
but you and that guy
might break up later on.

306
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,366
Just like me and Su-a.

307
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,123
Come on, Mom. Ride with me.

308
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,291
All right.

309
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,547
Hey, Mom. You're an adult.

310
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,257
Why can't you ride a two-wheeler?

311
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,259
Two-wheelers scare me.

312
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,052
You can't even open a soda can.

313
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,056
That's because I'm only nine.
I'll master that skill once I turn ten.

314
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,934
I'll learn to ride a two-wheeler
by the time I'm 40.

315
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,645
Even nine-year-olds can do it.

316
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,606
Gu-won. Don't let go, okay?

317
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,983
- Mom.
- Yeah?

318
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,860
You can't even ride a bike without me.

319
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,153
Are you really a mom?

320
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,072
Hey, I bought this bike and yours too.

321
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,991
Don't let go, okay?

322
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,742
Don't let go, all right?

323
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,872
I'm riding on my own?

324
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,083
Wow, this is so cool!

325
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,297
This is really fun, Gu-won.

326
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,728
COUPLE'S PARADISE

327
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,245
It takes skill to look this pitiful.

328
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,999
Didn't you say no one would use
this office for a while?

329
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,586
Not "for a while."
No one uses this office, period.

330
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,963
It just goes to show
how poorly we were treated.

331
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,759
Hey, I shot you guys up to the 20th floor.

332
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,554
Do you have to work here
and make me feel bad?

333
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,139
Looking all pitiful at that.

334
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:20,018
I'll just hang out here
since everything I need is already set up.

335
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,313
So, what are you working on? Got an idea?

336
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,497
This is refreshing.

337
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,456
Right?

338
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,375
Have you seen anything like this before?

339
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,918
No, never.

340
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,712
Who'd take this on?

341
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,632
I'm still working on it.

342
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,592
I'll show you once I finalize the details.

343
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,179
If you need my help with anything,

344
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,472
well, let me know, or not.

345
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:01,268
Oh, look at you. You ooze charisma
now that you're a head writer.

346
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,519
Whatever.

347
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,817
Anyway, how's Song Ki-baek doing?

348
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,655
"Mr. Song is on the Move!"

349
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,908
Today, I came here to meet
Mr. Heo Pung-seon,

350
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,870
also known as Mr. Balloon, who travels
all over the country with his balloons

351
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,498
and makes children laugh
everywhere he goes.

352
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,084
He's the second most popular celebrity
among kids,

353
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,586
number one being Pororo.

354
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,088
Thank you.

355
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,173
Many fans are here to see him.

356
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,009
Kids, do you like Mr. Balloon?

357
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,968
- Yes!
- Yes!

358
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,345
If you like Mr. Balloon, make some noise!

359
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,808
Oh, my. He's very popular indeed.

360
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,020
The children's innocent smiles are
lifting my spirits.

361
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,604
Attack Song Ki-baek!

362
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,522
- Hey.
- All right!

363
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,441
All right, kids. I'm Song Ki-baek!

364
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,574
I heard you do several
children's events like this daily.

365
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,783
It's amazing.

366
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,206
I'm so impressed that
you can keep smiling like that.

367
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,585
It makes me happy
to see someone look at me and smile.

368
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,921
Of course,
I've become a person who has to smile

369
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,631
even on days I don't want to.

370
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,675
But it would be weird
if a clown didn't smile.

371
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,471
A clown's smile?

372
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,724
I'm sure you know what I mean.

373
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,991
{\an8}THE SHOOT WENT WELL
HOPE YOUR DAY IS GOING WELL TOO

374
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,744
MR. SONG IS ON THE MOVE

375
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,128
<i>Did you call her?</i>

376
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:10,081
I'm moving abroad. I leave tomorrow

377
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,751
with my son and his family.

378
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,253
Once I leave,

379
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:21,301
I won't be able to see you
for a long time.

380
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,770
Do you know my name?

381
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,607
Woo-ju.

382
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,030
I had to start school,

383
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,742
but I didn't have a name.

384
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:51,873
We're not talking about a backpack,
running shoes or pretty clothes.

385
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,376
I didn't have a name,

386
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,671
so I couldn't go to school.

387
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,635
So my mom named me.

388
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,095
On Woo-ju.

389
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,563
In front of…

390
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,528
the children's home where you'd left me…

391
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,617
I was afraid someone would come out
and take me inside.

392
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,163
I thought I might never see you again
if that happened,

393
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,709
so I ran away and walked for a while.

394
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,588
Then I met Bok-ja.

395
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,468
It'll sound like an excuse,

396
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:52,183
but I did go back to that children's home
a few years later.

397
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,147
Ms. On Bok-ja had left
her contact information,

398
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,651
thinking your parents
might come back to find you.

399
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,197
But I didn't call her.

400
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,034
I just watched you from afar,

401
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,620
while hiding.

402
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,166
But this time, once I leave…

403
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:23,923
I may never get to see you again.

404
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,772
I'm sorry.

405
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,487
I'm so sorry for everything.

406
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,716
Stay healthy and take care of yourself.

407
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,219
I'll do the same.

408
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:41,292
Thank you for bringing me into this world
and for sending me to my mom.

409
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,963
Thank you.

410
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,082
Hey, Woo-ju.

411
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,169
Ki-baek.

412
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,147
I met my biological mother.

413
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,738
I had a lot on my mind
but now I know why I felt so conflicted.

414
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,493
I think I just missed her.

415
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,788
Do you feel better
now that you've met her?

416
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,249
I feel lighter.

417
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,586
I'm glad I listened to you
and met with her.

418
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,505
Oh, hold on.

419
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,306
It's for you.

420
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,143
This will make me look too cute.

421
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,064
Wow, I knew it'd look cute on you,
but this is way too cute.

422
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,067
So how was your day?

423
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,652
Oh, my day was…

424
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,449
All in all, I had a good day.

425
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,371
Why do your smiles seem fake
to me these days?

426
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,041
I haven't been fake smiling at all.

427
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,918
Are you lying…

428
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,464
It can't be a lie.

429
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,468
I may not look it,
but I'm a strong person.

430
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,846
- It's just a little strange.
- No, it isn't.

431
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,765
Let's go.

432
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:02,934
You're cute.

433
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,521
You always say I'm cute.

434
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,356
Well, because you are cute.

435
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,109
If you keep saying it,
it'll become a habit.

436
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,680
Did you drink?

437
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,848
No, I didn't.

438
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,851
Then we have a bigger problem.
Hey, Daughter.

439
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,561
Are you all right?

440
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm totally fine. Isn't this cute?

441
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,565
You're crazy.

442
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,027
I'm going to sleep here too.
Next to my mom.

443
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,531
Whatever. You're such a weirdo too.

444
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,867
I mean, what is this?

445
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,994
My goodness.

446
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,476

This is my job, and I drive safely.

450
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,414
You don't need to report everything to me.

451
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,541
You're trying to figure out your life.

452
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,418
Where's Dad going?

453
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,802

POOPY KI-BAEK

460
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,303
Ki-baek, are you all right?

461
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm really okay.

462
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,975
- So how was your day?
- I had a good day.

463
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,227
I may not look it,
but I'm a strong person.

464
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,366
Hello, Chief.

465
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,243
Yes, yes.

466
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,247
Yes. That's right.

467
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,624
Everyone uses a washing machine
to do laundry.

468
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,377
That is true,
but there's something very satisfying

469
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,754
about seeing
clean laundry hung on the line.

470
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,717
You want to shove me into
a washing machine? That's not good.

471
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,262
Wait, please don't say no outright.

472
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,681
Wait. Chief? Hello?

473
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,730
Oh, no.

474
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,568
Oh, I lost an earbud.
I was wondering if it was here.

475
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,652
Your earbud?

476
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,654
Where did it go?

477
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,365
Man, it's not here.

478
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,451
Call me if you see my earbud.

479
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,203
- Where could it be?
- All right.

THAT HAVE SAID YES!

482
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,677
I can't take this.

483
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,387
What? Did something happen?

484
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,722
My life is so boring.

485
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,223
There's nothing fun in life.

486
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,227
The same tasks, the same program.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

487
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:21,525
Maybe I should do something new,
something refreshing.

488
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,943
For example--

489
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,153
For example?

490
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,738
LAUNDRY

491
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,948
- Laundry?
- Hey.

492
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,744
Don't even. What did I say?
Even if you have to work as a servant--

493
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,373
Work for a wealthy family.
But I've done a lot of thinking,

494
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,999
and I think I'm a trailblazer.

495
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,918
I must've learned it from you.

496
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,045
So it's all on you.

497
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:44,256
No. I hope you didn't say
anything to I-na about--

498
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,133
He said nothing to me.

499
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,385
How mean.

500
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,389
Can't I do something refreshing
with you, Min-gu?

501
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
I'm really stressed out too.

502
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,643
And laundry is my specialty.

503
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,560
You know that.

504
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,523
How am I going to face Yeon
and Ha-young if you guys do this?

505
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,692
If we lined up the writers
who want to work on <i>Couple's Paradise,</i>

506
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,820
it would wrap around the block twice.

507
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,239
Still, this goes against my morals.

508
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,699
I don't think you can afford
to worry about that.

509
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,917
Anyway, you two. You're not hired yet.

510
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,503
- We'll work hard! Sparta!
- We'll work hard!

511
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,421
Woot, woot!

512
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,090
My goodness.

513
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,466
Did you put this together?

514
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,261
We must secure
as many product placements as we can.

515
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,054
- I taught you well.
- Please.

516
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,851
KIM JEONG-HEON'S MANAGER
KANG HYEONG-TAEK

517
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,113
MR. AN

518
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,365
THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS
HAVE BEEN APPROVED

519
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,287
SEND 3,000,000 WON
TO SONG IN-SU?

520
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,497
3,000,000 WON HAS BEEN SENT
TO SONG IN-SU

521
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,210
{\an8}FATHER

522
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:10,926
MOM WILL BE ALL RIGHT
DON'T OVERWORK YOURSELF

523
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:19,351
YOU NEED TO
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DAD

524
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,360
I SENT SOME MONEY
TO HELP OUT WITH EXPENSES

525
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,412
MY WOO-JU

526
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,666
Hi. I'm working.

527
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,960
<i>I'm at the playground.</i>

528
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,846
You couldn't lie. What happened?

529
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,184
<i>Now, I can lie.</i>

530
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:04,313
I think it all started here
after my mom's accident.

531
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:10,152
Then you can now hide your feelings
when you want to.

532
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,612
Isn't that a good thing?

533
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,366
Well, but I have no idea what's going on.

534
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,578
Suddenly, there was the switch.
Then it broke, and then…

535
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,749
It's so bizarre.

536
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,380
Well, you suddenly developed
the inability to hide your feelings.

537
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,924
Maybe it was triggered
by the accident at first.

538
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,343
Back then,
you suddenly couldn't lie at all.

539
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,804
Now you can lie whenever you want to.

540
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:42,768
Perhaps all of this was caused
by your desperate sincerity.

541
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,774
Your feelings toward Ms. On
couldn't be hidden because it was love.

542
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:55,281
And now you're lying
because you care for your family.

543
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:02,162
From now on,
I guess you can choose to lie or not.

544
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,210
<i>So I've decided to hide my feelings again.</i>

545
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,381
If I collapse, everything will fall apart.

546
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,386
I have to protect
my family and the people I love.

547
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:22,391
And I knew you'd be
even more heartbroken than me.

548
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,103
That's why I said I was okay.

549
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,107
Song Ki-baek!

550
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,109
Have you learned anything?

551
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,528
"Instead of worrying
what others might think

552
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,240
and keeping everything bottled up inside,
just say what you want to say."

553
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,242
You said that yourself, you idiot!

554
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,913
Sorry.

555
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,498
That's all right.

556
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,959
I thought it was odd.

557
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,129
You kept saying you were okay
when there's no way you could be.

558
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,507
But I knew you couldn't be forced,

559
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,302
so I told myself to just trust you
and wait. I thought,

560
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,473
if he comes to me to be comforted,
I'm going to give him a big hug.

561
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,228
I love you.

562
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,026
I hate you.

563
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,490
You don't need to hide stuff
from the people you love,

564
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,410
so don't hide anything from me
or your family either.

565
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,246
If you do, that is cheating.

566
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,318
{\an8}KIM JEONG-HEON INTERVIEW

567
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,075
Thought you couldn't stand
the sight of me.

568
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,537
You can't take your eyes off me.

569
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,455
All done.

570
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,502
When I was little…

571
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,215
I was happiest when we lived here,

572
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,634
although I never told you.

573
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,721
Mom said you liked this neighborhood too

574
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,560
and you wanted to visit where we lived
when my brother and I were kids.

575
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:36,567
I wanted to become super successful
and make you proud, Dad.

576
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,989
And Mom, who always worried about me,
I thought it'd make her smile too.

577
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,622
And the person I hurt in the past…

578
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,669
I thought things would be different
if we met again.

579
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,468
I don't know what I worked so hard for.

580

<i>The phone is turned off.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

<i>Jeong-heon disappeared</i>?

584
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,761
He said he wanted to retire.

<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if you might know where he could be.</i>

586

MY WOO-JU

587
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,410
Hey, you need to hear this.

588
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,662
Huh? What?

589
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,830
Dad got scammed!

590
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,249
What?

591
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,461
Dad handed over
Mom's leftover inventory and new orders

592
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,590
to some guy who offered to sell them,
but now he's gone AWOL.

593
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,736
No one's here?

594
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,951
It's not there.

595
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,514
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>the stationery store is this way?</i>

596
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,224
If we can't get glue, we're screwed.

597
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,144
Just trust me and follow me.
I know this town very well.

598
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,770
I don't think we'll find one.

599
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,232
Wow. How did you know
there was a stationery store here?

600
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,067
I lived here when I was little.

601
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,527
Really?

602
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,697
Yeah, I really loved living here.

603
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,490
It hasn't changed at all.

604
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,827
I'm going to live here once I retire.

605
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,746
I'll build a mansion.

606
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,165
Die, die.

607
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,336
Nice. You lost again.

608
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,671
Go practice some more.

609
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,175
But you lost yesterday. Scoot over.

610
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,762
- You lost. Give someone else a turn.
- Hurry up. Do better.

611
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,306
I told you not to hit me.

612
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,395
Hey, Woo-ju.

613
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,481
What are you doing here?

614
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,574
No one's inside?

615
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,117
Hurry up and go inside.

616
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,872
Dad, look. Over there.

617
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,341
Damn it.

618
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,640
- They're not here.
- Dad, here.

619
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,475
Should we take this?

620
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,893
Don't touch what's not ours.

621
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,980
Damn it. What if he already ran off?

622
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,360
They've just emptied this warehouse.

623
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,034
Someone's observant.

624
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,292
Let's get out of here.
This place is too dangerous.

625
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,210
What?

626
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,962
What's the point of staying here?

627
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,674
If we wait and ask for our stuff back,
you think he'll gladly give it back?

628
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,384
Then why did you follow us?

629
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,636
Should we stand idly by
and do nothing then?

630
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,054
We came all the way here.

631
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,393
I'm meeting Mr. Jang. I won't budge
until I get this situation sorted out.

632
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,271
I have to do something.

633
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,191
<i>I'll get it sorted out. Don't worry.</i>

634
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,694
<i>I'll figure something out.</i>

635
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,491
Dad, did your business go bust again?

636
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,996
Your homeroom teacher called.

637
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,290
Did you get into a fight at school?

638
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,208
Are you all right?

639
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,043
It was nothing.

640
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,089
Do I have to transfer to another school?

641
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,386
As for your transfer, I'll visit
your school tomorrow and take care of it.

642
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,598
Come on in. Let's eat.
I'll fix you dinner.

643
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,734
I'll run to the grocery store and--

644
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,527
Don't worry about it. I'm not hungry.

645
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,739
I forgot something at school.

646
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:18,950
I'll go.

647
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,874
Ki-baek.

648
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,214
I'm…

649
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,636
sorry I failed you and the family.

650
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,141
Why do I have to transfer again?

651
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,186
Why do we have to run away again?

652
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,105
Go on and let it all out.

653
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,441
I know how you feel.

654
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,695
Dad, what do you even know about me?

655
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,948
Do you know that I'm a senior?

656
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,242
I'm the top student.

657
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,494
I have the highest GPA.

658
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,747
Do you know what everyone calls me?

659
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,584
The top student. A brainiac who comes
from a happy, affluent family.

660
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,548
I clean stinky motel rooms
to buy my workbooks

661
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,301
and eat cold rice mixed with water
in our moldy basement apartment,

662
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,930
but I am Song Ki-baek,
the smart top student.

663
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,644
I can't take this.

664
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,315
I'm sick of being poor,

665
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,110
and I'm tired of my life
getting worse and worse,

666
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,613
no matter how many lies
I tell to make it better.

667
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:41,908
I'm sorry.

668
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,664
Seeing your faces
when you and Mom say you're sorry,

669
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,416
nothing makes me more miserable.

670
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,169
When I tell you and Mom that I've eaten

671
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,839
or that I'm doing fine,
you take my word for it.

672
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,843
You two are the worst. I hate you so much.

673
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,143
Ki-baek.

674
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,192
Ki-baek!

675
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,327
What happened?

676
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,411
Oh, my God!

677
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,370
What happened?

678
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,956
Isn't this a hit-and-run?
Sir, are you all right?

679
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,708
Are you all right?

680
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,588
Dad.

681
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,470
Just don't.

682
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,724
Please don't do anything.

683
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,730
Hey, come on.

684
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,607
It's not like Dad did it on purpose.

685
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,317
Mr. Jang, that swindler,

686
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,403
Mom and Dad have known him for years.

687
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,697
- That's enough.
- Why do you think Dad did it?

688
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,200
- It was all because of you!
- What?

689
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,036
You've always thought of us as a burden.

690
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,748
Useless burdens on
the smart Song Ki-baek's shoulders!

691
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,167
Have you ever thought of us as family?

692
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,963
Have you ever heard me say
that you were a burden?

693
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,839
I don't have to hear you say it.

694
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,218
Everything you do suffocates us.
Do you even realize that?

695
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:28,473
Dad did what he did
to help lighten your burdens!

696
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,516
So?

697
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,977
Did this help lighten them?

698
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,688
You guys. That's enough.

699
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,106
- Stay out of this.
- Stay out.

700
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,565
I will not stay out of it!

701
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,943
You always tell me that.

702
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,195
I always clean up your mess
after you two fight.

703
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,531
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

704
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,825
You're both such losers. Do you know that?

705
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,618
That is enough!

706
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,375
Hurry up and open it.

707
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,629
Can't you do a better job?

708
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,589
You're so weak.

709
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,966
Come on!

710
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,302
Hey, you're a big guy.
Why are you so weak?

711
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,889
The ship will arrive tonight,
so let's hurry up and get everything.

712
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,641
It's Mr. Jang.

713
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,268
Dad, what should we do?

714
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,230
Dad!

715
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,190
Hey, Jang Gu-pal.

716
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,987
Hey. Hold on.

717
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,740
Mr. Song. What are you doing here?

718
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,617
Your sons are here too.

719
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,540
You guys stay here.

720
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,460
This is my fight.

721
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,088
Either pay me for the products
or hand them over.

722
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,132
Why are you scowling? You look scary.

723
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,551
As you know,
the economy is terrible right now.

724
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,553
If you just wait, I'll pay you.

725
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,305
You're so impatient.

726
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,223
Hey.

727
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,727
It's all right.

728
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,562
I guess it's about time

729
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,899
I shared with you a secret
I've been keeping from you guys.

730
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,153
Back in the old days, I had a nickname.

731
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,326
Beethoven from Yeonggwang County.

732
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,788
What the--

733
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,540
All right. Let him meet his fate.

734
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,583
Beethoven?

735
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,005
Hey.

736
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,507
- You okay?
- Hey!

737
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,008
I can't hear anything!

738
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:32,055
Those who get punched in the ear by me
all become deaf.

739
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,390
<i>Ba-ba-ba-bam</i>

740
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,434
Whack him!

741
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,228
You piece of…

742
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,070
- Dad.
- Those idiots.

743
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,495
Hey! You little…

744
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,871
Un-baek!

745
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,458
How dare you.

746
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,421
Hey! You little…

747
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,422
- Let go!
- Dad!

748
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,384
Here.

749
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,149
PUNG

750
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,944
UN

751
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,948
KI

752
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,789
FATHER

753
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:40,707
Get up!

754
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,750
Get up, damn it. Thrash them!

755
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,710
Whack them.

756
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,669
- Hey!
- Hey!

757
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,628
You bastards!

758
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:51,885
Don't hit him.

759
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,471
- Let go.
- Dad!

760
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,098
Stop. Stop!

761
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,687
You, Jang Gu-pal.

762
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,273
Beethoven. No, I mean, Mr. Song.

763
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,192
We can talk it out.

764
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,486
Where are my products?

765
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,279
They're safe and sound.

766
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,780
Where are they?

767
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,367
In the truck behind the warehouse.

768
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,171
- Did you call the police?
- No.

769
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,173
It wasn't me either.

770
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,175
Damn it.

771
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,510
- Hide. Quick.
- Okay.

772
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,969
Shit!

773
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,810
- What are you doing?
- Want your face to be on the news again?

774
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,356
If you think we'll get caught,
I'll walk out first.

775
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,233
You stay here and don't come out.

776
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,693
You're under arrest for theft and fraud.

777
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,403
You have the right to remain silent.

778
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,156
Anything you say can be used against you,

779
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,991
and you have the right to an attorney.

780
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,159
You know the drill.

781
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,994
No, I don't know.

782
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:03,456
By the way, those guys,
why aren't you arresting them?

783
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,582
Beethoven!

784
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,917
Over there!

785
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,168
Drop your head.

786
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,337
They're gangsters. They're right there!

787
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,297
Take him. You two, come with me.

788
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,566
What? There's nothing back here.

789
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,859
Hey, let's go.

790
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,323
We got all of them, right?

791
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,284
We're done here, then. Let's go!

792
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,711
I think they're gone.

793
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:50,712
Come out.

794
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,608
Dad.

795
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,192
I admit that I'm a loser.

796
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,240
I'm incompetent and unlucky in life.

797
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:23,828
My wife and children are all I have.
And that's why I've always felt so bad.

798
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,165
I didn't want to have to say sorry

799
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,209
even if I never got to hear thank you,
but I keep messing things up.

800
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,173
But I'm still your dad, you know.

801
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,303
If there are things I can do for you,
I'll gladly do them

802
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,640
until the day I die.

803
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,645
We call each other family
and live together,

804
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:53,107
but we never rely on
or vent to each other, you know.

805
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,446
Son.

806
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,491
Son.

807
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,494
And you, Son.

808
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,081
Now, I need your help.

809
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,750
Help me, please.

810
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,349
I heard you wanted to retire.

811
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,186
Still, how could you run away?

812
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,816
Man, I never thought you'd track me down.

813
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,027
You're really something.

814
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,572
You're cracking a joke right now?

815
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,952
One day, I just didn't want
to do anything.

816
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,496
I didn't want to work or play.

817
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,874
Everything frustrated me.
How should I put this?

818
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,212
It was as if I was trapped
in a nightmare all day.

819
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,425
When the going got rough,
I worked harder.

820
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,510
And I started thinking that it was unfair.

821
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,972
I mean, why put up with it all?

822
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,017
It's not like I got anything
out of trying so hard.

823
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:14,522
I just wanted to relax and take it easy,
but I didn't know how.

824
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,526
So as you can see,

825
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,612
I shut everything off
and ran away like a loser.

826
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,991
You can just say that you need a break

827
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,618
and tell them why
you want to take it easy.

828
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:29,787
Tell who?

829
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,423
You don't have to go back.

830
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,302
Nothing's more important than yourself.

831
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,804
Nothing can take precedence
when you feel like you're dying.

832
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,227
Just think that you're hibernating.

833
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,357
Did you know raccoons hibernate too?

834
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,195
How do you know these things?

835
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,992
Get some restful sleep.
Then when you wake up,

836
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,328
it'll be spring.

837
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,435
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

838
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,688
I'm not proud of the things I've done.

839
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:42,276
I know what you all think of me
and how much you care for me.

840
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:48,157
But I always avoided you, saying I felt
uncomfortable and smothered.

841
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,078
It's all my fault.

842
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,206
The family's real burden was…

843
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,209
It was me.

844
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,754
I'm sorry.

845
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,223
I know

846
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,144
my accident must've been
a huge burden on your heart.

847
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,233
Since you've told me
your honest feelings for the first time,

848
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,486
I'll do the same.

849
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,658
I'm sorry…

850
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,414
and thank you.

851
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,918
Dad.

852
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,853
Sorry I yelled at you earlier, Ki-baek.

853
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,731
You too, Un-baek.

854
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:03,691
Cut it out.

855
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,308
Dad.

856
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,812
MISSED CALL
