1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,968
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:49,929
It was yellow.

3
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:51,806
It was blue.

4
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,266
I'm positive it was yellow.

5
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,185
- No, it was blue.
- What?

6
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,479
I've watched that movie so many times.

7
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,690
I was a huge fan of that actress.

8
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,068
Wanna bet?

9
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,363
- Winner gets a wish.
- You're on.

10
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,283
- Let me look it up.
- Hold on.

11
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:14,078
Why don't you go back
and see for yourself?

12
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:17,498
You should be able to do that
if you were such a fan.

13
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,668
Maybe I will.

14
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,464
I watched it at my friend's
in high school.

15
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,843
- I never cry during movies, okay?
- Okay.

16
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:30,928
But with that one,

17
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:34,223
I bawled my eyes out with my friends.

18
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,977
That's great.
You'll get to see your friends too.

19
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,648
Fine. I'll be right back.

20
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,275
See you.

21
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,492
I won...

22
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:06,797
Da-hae.

23
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:08,966
Da-hae.

24
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,062
What...

25
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,784
Why?

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,834
{\an8}5 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

27
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,471
{\an8}Welcome.

28
00:02:58,849 --> 00:02:59,934
{\an8}You actually came.

29
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:03,437
{\an8}You're a perfect fit for this family.

30
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,607
{\an8}You have superpower-grade shamelessness.

31
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,278
{\an8}You're awfully chatty
for someone who'll be out of here soon.

32
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,281
{\an8}You said you'd start your own family.

33
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,200
{\an8}Take your sarcasm to your own place.

34
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,328
{\an8}Have a seat. Don't mind her.

35
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,750
Join us, Ms. Bok.

36
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:27,419
"Ms. Bok"?

37
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,048
Did you really just call me that?

38
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,091
That's my mom's name.

39
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,426
Come on.

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,179
Call me Dong-hee.

41
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,807
But that's as far as I'll allow today.

42
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,642
I'm not eating with you.

43
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:47,273
Come on.

44
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,804
Are you not hungry?

45
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,475
This just feels so surreal.

46
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:25,978
We're eating together as a family.

47
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:28,898
You're back in the house,

48
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:30,774
as if nothing ever happened.

49
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,153
And you let Da-hae into the family.

50
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:40,451
It almost seems too good to be true.

51
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,661
I'm just grateful.

52
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,582
No one can defy what I see in my dreams.

53
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,342
I had a dream...

54
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,552
{\an8}7 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

55
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:00,512
{\an8}...where we held a funeral without a body.

56
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,807
Who was it for?

57
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,893
Bok Gwi-ju.

58
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,312
My own son.

59
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:12,107
He's going to go back in time
to save you from the fire 13 years ago.

60
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:15,069
He won't make it back
because he'll die in the fire.

61
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,946
We won't even be able to recover his body.

62
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,448
That moment will

63
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,617
finally...

64
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:24,370
destroy Gwi-ju.

65
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,457
We can try to keep that from happening.

66
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:31,377
The future I see in my dream
is inevitable.

67
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:34,922
We should tell Gwi-ju
not to go back to that moment.

68
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:38,550
He would gladly jump into the fire
even if he knew he'd die.

69
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:43,097
This is crazy.

70
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,141
We should at least try to convince him!

71
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:49,853
There must be a way.

72
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,314
I've tried everything a long time ago.

73
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,739
I dreamed about my own father's death.

74
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,742
I tried everything I could.

75
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:08,747
But the harder I tried to get away,
the faster fate caught up with me.

76
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,249
As if it were mocking me.

77
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,085
There's only one thing we can do.

78
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,295
Keeping him happy

79
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,049
for as long as he's around.

80
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:23,262
I'll let him do whatever he wants,

81
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,850
even if it means
letting him marry a swindler.

82
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:31,061
Move in with us.

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,606
No.

84
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,650
This is ridiculous.

85
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:41,405
How can I stay by his side,
knowing he'll die because of me?

86
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,615
I can't do that.

87
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,825
You're a swindler.

88
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,243
So swindle him.

89
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:50,039
- What?
- Give him a perfect moment of happiness.

90
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:55,252
Think of it as the last scam
you pull on him.

91
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:01,759
- Ms. Bok.
- Do you think this is easy for me?

92
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,970
I'm letting you into my family,

93
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,764
knowing you'll be the death of him.

94
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,185
This is all for Gwi-ju's sake.

95
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,312
Please.

96
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:17,232
I'm begging you.

97
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:28,952
How's I-na?

98
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,705
Is everything okay at her school?

99
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,500
Who was the last to leave the gym?

100
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,340
Me?

101
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,928
Weren't you the last one to leave?

102
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:49,306
We all left the gym together,
but you went back in.

103
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,517
Right, guys?

104
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:52,893
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,021
Now I remember.

106
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,440
You guys didn't clean up after eating,

107
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,275
so I went back in to take care of it.

108
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,486
- Wow.
- What?

109
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:07,783
Lying will only make things worse.

110
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,623
You're the ones who looked down on her
and teased her.

111
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,708
It wasn't me.

112
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,168
I swear.

113
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:20,504
Damn it, it wasn't me.

114
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,967
Hye-rim, stay behind.

115
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,218
The rest of you can go.

116
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:37,938
It really wasn't me.

117
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:39,648
I didn't even know I-na was there.

118
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,566
I swear.

119
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:41,483
Either way,

120
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,611
one of you locked the door
while you were there.

121
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,530
I won't take further action

122
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,700
because there's no proof,
and I-na doesn't want anyone punished.

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,909
But...

124
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,495
this better not happen again.

125
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,164
Got it?

126
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:58,167
I'm so shocked by Hye-rim.

127
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,544
She pretended to be so nice and cool,

128
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,337
taking care of the loner,

129
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,548
and then locked I-na in the storage?

130
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:07,092
She gives me the shivers.

131
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,553
I think I know why she did it.

132
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:10,512
- Why?
- Why?

133
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:13,807
I-na was the one that Jun-woo asked out.

134
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,476
- Really?
- No way.

135
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,228
I-na and Jun-woo
are officially together now.

136
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:22,691
She must have gotten jealous
and shown her true self.

137
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:23,734
She's so scary.

138
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,277
I know, she's so two-faced.

139
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:29,323
In the back of my mind,
I always knew she was bad news.

140
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,492
- Let's go.
- Unbelievable.

141
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:33,243
What a poser.

142
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,536
Let's just ignore her.

143
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,125
You believe me, right?

144
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:43,754
It wasn't me.

145
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,631
I can find out if it was you

146
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,633
just by looking at your eyes.

147
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,051
Exactly.

148
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,595
We understood each other
just by looking at each other.

149
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,431
But I don't want to look anymore.

150
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,433
Not at your eyes...

151
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,269
or at your heart.

152
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,232
What?

153
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,278
You should have done a better job
hiding your feelings.

154
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,657
Now everyone knows who you really are.

155
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,618
And how mean you are.

156
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,454
I-na!

157
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:18,997
Let's go!

158
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,428
Why don't we move elsewhere?

159
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,517
And leave the house
we've lived in for generations?

160
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,477
I thought we might try downsizing.

161
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:44,439
We can't afford this huge house anymore.

162
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,111
We can put Dong-hee
in charge of the gym building.

163
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:54,658
And as for taking care of you,
mother, and I-na...

164
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,411
I'll be in charge of that.

165
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,754
- Gwi-ju.
- I want a fresh start.

166
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:15,012
- Gwi-ju.
- Let's do that.

167
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:18,015
Let's do as Gwi-ju says.

168
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,934
Let's move.

169
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,244
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

170
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,289
I can't keep up this damn charade anymore.

171
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,832
Lower your voice.

172
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:46,668
You heard how
obliviously mature he sounded.

173
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,632
Are we really going to move?

174
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:56,136
It's only a matter of time
before we lose this house anyway.

175
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,721
If we're going to move,

176
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,807
let's move abroad with Gwi-ju.

177
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,893
Let's take him far away from Do Da-hae.

178
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:06,229
If we can't prevent it,
we should at least stall it out.

179
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,231
You can't do anything about it.

180
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:12,652
Don't forget
this is just a temporary arrangement.

181
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:15,655
Once Gwi-ju is gone, it's over between us.

182
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:19,034
So just focus on being here
as Gwi-ju's dad.

183
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,381
<i>Keep this a secret.</i>

184
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,093
Once Gwi-ju is gone,

185
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,637
you can finally have the building

186
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,430
all to yourself.

187
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:42,849
How can you say that?

188
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:45,852
I'm Gwi-ju's sister.

189
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:47,646
He's my little brother.

190
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,648
Don't tell him anything.

191
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,608
Just act normal.

192
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,151
It's that easy.

193
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:58,365
Why did you have to
have a dream like that?

194
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,997
You were so desperate to dream.

195
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:09,292
You couldn't stop stealing dreams.

196
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,545
And you accuse <i>me</i> of being greedy?

197
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,675
Don't you think you're being punished
for your own greed?

198
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,846
Was ruining my life not enough?

199
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,307
Your dream is killing Gwi-ju!

200
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:26,977
This is your fault!

201
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:38,280
Are you crying?

202
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:42,325
I'm just sweating.

203
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:46,413
Take a little break.

204
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:49,666
Go away.

205
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,592
Are you having fun, I-na?

206
00:13:58,592 --> 00:13:59,676
Yeah!

207
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,222
- Be careful.
- Okay.

208
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:29,789
- How's this one?
- It's so cute.

209
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,170
I'm gonna...

210
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,505
check out some other ones.

211
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,589
Pick out some more.

212
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,931
You look great.

213
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:52,687
How's this one?

214
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,689
It's so cute.

215
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,235
I think...

216
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:00,028
I'll go with these.

217
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,571
How do I look?

218
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:04,616
I picked mine out.

219
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:07,369
- This one's perfect for you, I-na.
- Try it on.

220
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,411
Let's see.

221
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,999
That's adorable.

222
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,251
Here we go.

223
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:16,211
One, two, three.

224
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:17,337
Cheese.

225
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,550
- One, two, three.
- Where's your cheek?

226
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:32,269
Come in.

227
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,110
Why are you here?

228
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,612
Where else would I be?

229
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:44,823
Well, I mean...

230
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,119
Dad changed the bedding
in my room for some reason.

231
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,162
Apparently,

232
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,125
it's goose down or something.

233
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:59,337
I'm good here.

234
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:04,259
Okay.

235
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:08,889
Good night then.

236
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,231
Hey, I-na.

237
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:19,524
You're still up.

238
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:22,736
I was just getting some water, and...

239
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,156
And...

240
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,200
I just...

241
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,493
You're stupid.

242
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,255
Let's have another wedding.

243
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:44,674
I don't want to.

244
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,426
The last one was crazy enough.

245
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:47,844
Should we register our marriage first?

246
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,429
Is that necessary?

247
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:52,766
Or I could go back to the moment
I-na was born right now.

248
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:53,767
No.

249
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,644
You can't do that.

250
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,189
Why not?

251
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:02,776
I can't wait to go back
to 13 years ago and save you.

252
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,277
And give you the ring.

253
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:09,282
We agreed to put that off for a bit.

254
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:12,744
Tell you what.

255
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,246
Once we really become family,

256
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,290
you can go back then.

257
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:22,462
How much longer
are you going to be a guest here?

258
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,006
What's the hurry?

259
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,843
We'll have plenty of time
to think about that

260
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,554
after your sister's wedding.

261
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:33,848
Okay?

262
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,862
You can eat today.

263
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:51,408
As your trainer,
I'm allowing you a cheat day.

264
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,167
How's Dodari doing?

265
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,921
I told you not to ask me
about that scammer.

266
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,257
You should cut her some slack.

267
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:09,050
Don't give her a hard time.

268
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:13,638
She left you guys at the sauna
after all those years

269
00:18:13,638 --> 00:18:16,307
to enjoy a life of luxury on her own.

270
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,351
How can you say that?

271
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:22,188
Because we're family.

272
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:25,525
You can be mean to her if you want.

273
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:29,529
You don't stand a chance
against her anyway.

274
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,035
What did you say?

275
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:40,206
My mom is the real problem.

276
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,585
There's no way
she'll let her go so easily.

277
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:51,634
I got everything ready.

278
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,262
But let me ask you one last time.

279
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:56,848
Are you sure?

280
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,187
Is this what you want?

281
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,606
We have to give her a proper goodbye.

282
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,499
There's a leak in my room.

283
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,168
Water's dripping onto my bed.

284
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,633
It's late,
so I'll have to crash here tonight.

285
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,676
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,888
What's a real family anyway?

287
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,390
Family's nothing special.

288
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,392
We're family if we eat and sleep together.

289
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,438
Excuse me.

290
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,360
Your pillow isn't so comfortable.

291
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,820
Mine is goose down.

292
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:59,077
That's better.

293
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,662
This is nice.

294
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:05,166
Is my head heavy?

295
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:07,460
A little.

296
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,713
I'll be saving your life.

297
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,216
I can borrow your arm, can't I?

298
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:20,723
I'll let you borrow mine
when I'm back here from the future.

299
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:24,102
What?

300
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,522
When I come back from the future,

301
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,941
you can rest your head on my arm.

302
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm sure

303
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,285
I'll come back to this moment someday.

304
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,164
I'm really happy right now.

305
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,757
This is nice.

306
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,344
Do you want to...

307
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:01,931
go on a trip?

308
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,810
Sure, let's do it.

309
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,651
All right.

310
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,862
Let's do it.

311
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:33,213
Perfect weather for the beach.

312
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,424
I could really use some coffee though.

313
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:40,220
Hold on.

314
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,807
This will do the trick.

315
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,192
- It's so good.
- Good thinking.

316
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:57,403
Don't worry.

317
00:21:58,446 --> 00:21:59,739
Why don't you let me drive?

318
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,950
I love driving in the rain.

319
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,954
But I am getting a little chilly.

320
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,330
Are you cold?

321
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,166
It's okay. Just hand me my jacket.

322
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,633
- Let me put it on you.
- Oh my.

323
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:23,638
Thank you.

324
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,309
Do you remember this jacket?

325
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,354
Hey, it's the one I bought you.

326
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:33,439
What? As if.

327
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,899
Well, I paid for it.

328
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,151
After you ruined my blouse.

329
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,612
Hey, you were smiling then.

330
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:41,489
No, I wasn't.

331
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:43,574
Yes, you were.

332
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:46,953
That was the first time
I'd ever seen you smile.

333
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,707
I just remember being really annoyed
by some weird lady.

334
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,336
Go back and see for yourself.

335
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:56,504
You can do that, right?

336
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:59,173
Sure, I'll be right back.

337
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:00,299
See you.

338
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,596
Let me help you.

339
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:27,493
Give me that.

340
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,377
Did you see it? Was I right?

341
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:38,504
I guess I smiled.

342
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:39,547
I told you.

343
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,631
My bad.

344
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,509
Do you like the color yellow?

345
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:48,056
There's this movie that I love,

346
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,850
and the female lead
wears a yellow cardigan.

347
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:55,480
I can't remember the title right now.

348
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:59,901
The man runs a photo studio,
and the woman is a parking attendant.

349
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,403
- Have you seen it?
- Hold on.

350
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,365
- The man's terminally ill, right?
- Yes.

351
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:09,035
And he disappears
without saying anything to her.

352
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,453
- Yes.
- Leaving a picture behind.

353
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,621
Exactly.

354
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:16,709
The woman is wearing
a yellow cardigan in that picture.

355
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:20,421
Wasn't it a blue sweater?

356
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:22,882
It was yellow.

357
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,426
It was blue.

358
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:27,762
I'm positive it was yellow.

359
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:29,680
- No, it was blue.
- What?

360
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:31,974
I've watched that movie so many times.

361
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:34,268
I was a huge fan of that actress.

362
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:37,563
Wanna bet?

363
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:40,858
- Winner gets a wish.
- You're on.

364
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:44,779
- Let me look it up.
- Hold on.

365
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:47,573
Why don't you go back
and see for yourself?

366
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:50,952
You should be able to do that
if you were such a fan.

367
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:54,163
Maybe I will.

368
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,960
I watched it at my friend's
in high school.

369
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,338
- I never cry during movies, okay?
- Okay.

370
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:04,423
But with that one,

371
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:07,802
I bawled my eyes out with my friends.

372
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,514
That's great.
You'll get to see your friends too.

373
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,144
Fine. I'll be right back.

374
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:17,770
See you.

375
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:43,337
I won...

376
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:58,102
Da-hae.

377
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:07,987
Da-hae.

378
00:26:11,824 --> 00:26:13,367
What...

379
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:34,138
The passenger saw nothing.

380
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:37,767
He just keeps saying it happened
in the blink of an eye.

381
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,311
It must have happened that quickly.

382
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,146
The shock may have fried his memory.

383
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,649
But he doesn't seem injured at all.

384
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,235
Not even a scratch.

385
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:48,945
The dashcam is broken too.

386
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:50,238
It doesn't make sense.

387
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:53,866
There's an accident around here
every time it rains or snows.

388
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:57,495
Let's find that missing person.

389
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:58,412
Yes, sir.

390
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,301
Search everywhere!

391
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:15,763
From the river mouth to the bushes!

392
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,640
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

393
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:20,309
It's dangerous here.

394
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,480
Get closer to the river!

395
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:31,904
Report every little thing you find!

396
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:35,950
- We can't let you through.
- Step back, sir.

397
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,952
- I have to...
- We're sorry.

398
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:51,340
Make sure to search every corner!

399
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,717
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

400
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:14,947
What do we have so far?

401
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:16,157
We're still searching,

402
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,451
but we've found nothing.

403
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:21,495
Seriously?

404
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:23,205
We haven't found a thing.

405
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:26,334
We've searched along the entire river,

406
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,626
but nothing's turned up.

407
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:34,759
Not again.

408
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,676
Stop him.

409
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:38,471
- Stop, it's dangerous here!
- Stop him!

410
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:42,892
Grab him!

411
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:46,062
Grab him!

412
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:55,196
- It's dangerous here!
- Get him out of here!

413
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,824
Get him out!

414
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,790
It's not safe for you to be here!

415
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,292
- You, call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:12,880
I found something!

417
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,823
Is this what she was wearing?

418
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,046
We found something.

419
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,002
Good work, everyone.

420
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:34,170
Let's move out.

421
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:25,513
{\an8}PALACE SAUNA

422
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:27,681
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

423
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,110
It was you, wasn't it?

424
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:48,494
You did this to Da-hae.

425
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:50,162
Answer me, damn it!

426
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:52,164
Let him go.

427
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:59,380
I heard the car skidded in the rain.

428
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:06,554
But I don't remember having
some superpower that controls rain.

429
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,180
You made it look like an accident.

430
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:12,810
And what were you doing right next to her?

431
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,981
I heard she was thrown
through the windshield

432
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:19,108
and fell into the river.

433
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,236
Didn't you even buckle her up?

434
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,534
Where the hell were you taking her
in the pouring rain?

435
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,828
You even made her drive.

436
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:36,584
I don't understand
how I'm responsible for any of that.

437
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:47,177
And now you show up here
without a scratch on your body

438
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:48,470
and say that?

439
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,557
Don't put the blame on me.

440
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,313
I thought you had superpowers.

441
00:32:58,105 --> 00:32:59,398
What were you doing?

442
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:01,734
Why can't you find her?

443
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,112
Why couldn't you save her?

444
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,152
Are you...

445
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:49,114
Yes.

446
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:51,659
I'm drinking again.

447
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,371
I thought I was finally back on track,

448
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,207
but nothing's changed.

449
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:01,293
Gwi-ju.

450
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,212
I thought it'd be different this time.

451
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,757
I thought I could make a difference.

452
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,010
But I ended up like this again.

453
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:13,430
I can't do anything.

454
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:16,600
Da-hae is gone.

455
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:20,479
I have to go back and find out...

456
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,941
how it all happened.

457
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,823
I have to find her.

458
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,931
Ms. Da-hae.

459
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:00,185
You're alive, aren't you?

460
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,688
I can't believe this.

461
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,525
It's exactly like seven years ago.

462
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:09,236
I know.

463
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:11,613
I can't believe it either.

464
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:15,034
But if I'm being honest,

465
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,829
I'm kind of relieved.

466
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,582
Watch your mouth.

467
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:26,712
Look, I feel sorry for Da-hae,

468
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:31,383
but if Gwi-ju loses his power
to go back to the past,

469
00:35:32,593 --> 00:35:35,804
he might not die just yet.

470
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,810
Could Gwi-ju's future have changed?

471
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:57,284
I was foolish.

472
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:02,664
It was only natural
that we lost our powers.

473
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,541
In modern society,

474
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,712
superpowers don't mean anything anymore.

475
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:13,300
The fact that we lost our powers
due to lifestyle diseases proves it.

476
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:17,346
Even I-na was born without powers.

477
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:19,723
It's just natural selection.

478
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:21,683
You were so obsessed with superpowers.

479
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:25,187
- Why the sudden change of heart?
- I'm tired.

480
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:28,649
My insomnia must have been
a blessing from our ancestors.

481
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:30,776
They were telling me to stop dreaming.

482
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,402
That it was okay to stop.

483
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,198
You don't have to try
to go back to the past either.

484
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,076
Let's live in the present from now on.

485
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:41,120
We'll live a normal life,

486
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,539
adapting to the times like everyone else.

487
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,416
Stop looking back.

488
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:02,933
Wow.

489
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,687
Welcome back, Dong-hee.

490
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,523
You look gorgeous.

491
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:11,984
Hey.

492
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:15,654
Can we postpone our wedding?

493
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:19,700
What for?

494
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,244
My brother's going through a lot.

495
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:25,289
Can we wait until he's feeling better?

496
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:29,376
Didn't you say
he was always a bit depressed?

497
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:32,337
Aren't you concerned about him at all?

498
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:36,300
Of course, but I'm also upset.

499
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,219
We already sent out invitations,
and it's just around the corner.

500
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,597
Our business is on the line too.

501
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:43,891
Hold on.

502
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:48,562
See? My phone's been blowing up.

503
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:50,898
This franchise wants to
open a store in our building.

504
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,983
I'll be right back, okay?

505
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:55,485
Hello?

506
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:06,955
Will you give me a break?
I'm not going anywhere, babe.

507
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,877
I'll open a salad café for you,

508
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,213
so you just think about what to call it.

509
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:15,881
Got it?

510
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,153
Over there.

511
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:42,115
Why does he keep coming to the scrapyard
looking for his car?

512
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:43,200
That's him.

513
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:46,954
Sir.

514
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:50,332
You really need to stop coming here.

515
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:54,211
Like I told you,
we scrapped that car ages ago.

516
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:58,006
We have work to do, so please leave.

517
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,925
Show him out.

518
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:01,969
- Let's go, sir.
- It's not safe here.

519
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,845
- We'll have to call the cops on you.
- Come on.

520
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:05,847
There you are!

521
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:09,434
Hello, sir.

522
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,979
I'll get him out of here. I'm his sister.

523
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,274
Please hurry up.

524
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:18,151
Okay. Have a nice day.

525
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,403
Bye.

526
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,538
Dad.

527
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:32,791
I-na.

528
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,382
Why are you looking for the car?

529
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,467
You'll never find it.

530
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,344
Even if you did,
it wouldn't change a thing.

531
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:47,431
Da-hae is alive.

532
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:49,308
They searched everywhere.

533
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:51,018
Even to the bottom of the river.

534
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:53,520
Mother dreamt about me

535
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,106
saving Da-hae.

536
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:58,984
It hasn't come true yet.

537
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,069
Mom is getting old.

538
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,448
We've lost all our superpowers for good.

539
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:05,615
No.

540
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,409
We have you.

541
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,870
You can fly now, can't you?

542
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,079
Please find the car.

543
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,749
There might be some clues left in it.

544
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,084
Me?

545
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,764
I never should have come here.

546
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,542
Let's go home.

547
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,878
Let's just go.

548
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:02,798
Take I-na home.

549
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:04,174
Get a hold of yourself!

550
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:06,593
You're not the only one struggling.

551
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:09,137
The whole family is in shambles.

552
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,932
Do you even know
that I'm getting married next week?

553
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,566
We're never going to change.

554
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:25,028
We'll always be like this.

555
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:28,615
Let's go, I-na.

556
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,631
Some things have changed.

557
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:55,809
For one thing,

558
00:41:57,477 --> 00:41:59,229
I've grown up a bit.

559
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:05,068
She was the first person

560
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:08,321
I wasn't scared to look in the eye.

561
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:14,494
And she was the one
who brought you and me closer.

562
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:18,290
She's our family.

563
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:23,295
So you have to find her.

564
00:42:25,464 --> 00:42:26,381
Go back to the past.

565
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:29,217
You can do it, Dad.

566
00:43:03,543 --> 00:43:05,003
Are you having fun, I-na?

567
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:06,004
Yeah!

568
00:43:11,384 --> 00:43:12,511
Da-hae.

569
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:14,721
Da-hae.

570
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:16,431
Da-hae!

571
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:21,561
Do Da-hae!

572
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:27,609
Da-hae!

573
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:51,383
- How's this one?
- It's so cute.

574
00:43:58,223 --> 00:43:59,975
I'm gonna...

575
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:01,434
check out some other ones.

576
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:02,435
Pick out some more.

577
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:05,605
Da-hae.

578
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:07,566
Da-hae!

579
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:10,944
How's this one?

580
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,154
It's so cute.

581
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:17,242
I think...

582
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:18,702
I'll go with these.

583
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:19,661
How do I look?

584
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,209
Did it feel like
she was avoiding eye contact?

585
00:44:29,254 --> 00:44:30,297
Come to think of it,

586
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,426
when I looked into her eyes,

587
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:37,679
<i>she suddenly started singing</i>

588
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:41,016
the national anthem in her mind.

589
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,978
I just found it funny at the time,

590
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:46,938
so I laughed it off.

591
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,651
What was she hiding?

592
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,320
Go back to another time.

593
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,704
Da-hae.

594
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:17,510
You're actually here.

595
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,065
Why are you crying?

596
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,070
Are you here to let me borrow your arm?

597
00:45:38,406 --> 00:45:39,783
Why are you crying?

598
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:45,955
It's just...

599
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:52,170
I had a nightmare.

600
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:04,182
What's wrong?

601
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:13,483
Listen carefully.

602
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:15,276
Don't go on that trip.

603
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:17,570
And don't drive.

604
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,864
No, don't get in the car at all.

605
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:21,991
All right?

606
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:26,413
What's this all about?

607
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,461
There will be an accident.

608
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:35,922
The car will skid in the rain

609
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:38,967
on our way to the beach.

610
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,094
And you...

611
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:43,388
You...

612
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:48,393
So do as I say.

613
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:49,894
Don't go on that trip.

614
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:52,689
Please don't go anywhere.

615
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,193
Promise me.

616
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,821
Please, Da-hae.

617
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:02,866
You can't go.

618
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:11,416
What happened to Da-hae?

619
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:15,003
- What do you mean?
- I told her everything.

620
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:17,380
- I told her about the accident.
- Really?

621
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:33,354
DRIVER IN HER THIRTIES MISSING IN RIVER
AFTER A WET ROAD CRASH

622
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:34,481
How come...

623
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,691
nothing has changed?

624
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:38,693
Are you sure you told her?

625
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:40,987
Did she understand what you said?

626
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,701
Is it impossible to change...

627
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:50,121
what's already happened?

628
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:56,461
This doesn't make sense.

629
00:47:57,629 --> 00:47:58,505
I think...

630
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:01,758
she knew there would be an accident.

631
00:48:06,095 --> 00:48:07,263
She knew?

632
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,600
But why would she...

633
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,983
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

634
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:27,075
Hey!

635
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:30,662
We need to talk.

636
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:33,206
- Please.
- What?

637
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:42,549
- What?
- You know something, don't you?

638
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:44,759
What was Ms. Da-hae hiding?

639
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,137
You knew there'd be an accident,
didn't you?

640
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:49,556
Shut up. Go away.

641
00:48:57,272 --> 00:48:59,566
Hey, wait!

642
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,031
Was Da-hae hiding something?

643
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:09,701
Kid's talking nonsense.

644
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:14,289
Did you take care of everything
like I said?

645
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:16,833
Yes.

646
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:18,710
Hey.

647
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:20,795
Look what I got in the mail.

648
00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:31,139
TRAFFIC TICKET

649
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,892
The accident happened at the river.
What were you doing at the beach?

650
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,937
I felt uneasy after finishing the job,

651
00:49:38,563 --> 00:49:39,606
so I went for some air.

652
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:44,527
Give me your phone.

653
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:53,953
NO CALL HISTORY

654
00:49:55,288 --> 00:49:56,247
NO MESSAGES

655
00:49:57,665 --> 00:49:59,083
It's clean.

656
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,793
Almost too clean.

657
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,674
Get the car.

658
00:50:10,762 --> 00:50:12,847
- Where are we going?
- To the beach you were at.

659
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:16,351
I could use some air too.

660
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:21,606
Ms. Da-hae is alive, isn't she?

661
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:23,691
I know you didn't kill her.

662
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,234
You're not that kind of person.

663
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,206
Listen, kid.

664
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:46,964
If you show up here again,

665
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:49,050
you're dead.

666
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:51,678
Let's go.

667
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,406
Dad.

668
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,784
I know where Ms. Da-hae is.

669
00:51:15,702 --> 00:51:16,619
What?

670
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:18,705
She's alive.

671
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:25,503
Are you serious?

672
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:28,172
Hurry.

673
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,882
We have to find her first.

674
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:32,009
<i>Give him a perfect moment of happiness.</i>

675
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:36,764
{\an8}Think of it as the last scam
you pull on him.

676
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,893
No, we can't make him happy.

677
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:42,937
Not if we want him to live.

678
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:45,898
I'll...

679
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,276
save Gwi-ju.

680
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:52,447
I was the one who got him his power back,

681
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,407
so I should be the one to take it away.

682
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,161
Do you mean to make him
unable to go back in time?

683
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:01,080
The last scam I pull on Gwi-ju...

684
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,584
won't make him happy.

685
00:52:06,294 --> 00:52:07,920
It'll make him miserable.

686
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:10,798
{\an8}You want to fool someone
who has a superpower?

687
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:12,717
{\an8}I can do it with your help.

688
00:52:12,717 --> 00:52:14,886
Bok Gwi-ju can return to the past.

689
00:52:14,886 --> 00:52:16,637
He could just go back in time

690
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,014
and see what happened.

691
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,724
He won't be able to go back.

692
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,812
The accident will happen
while he's in the past.

693
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:29,108
And once I'm gone,

694
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:31,527
it won't be easy for him
to return to the past.

695
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,614
That's what I'm trying to do.

696
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:36,657
He came to you from the future

697
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,619
and warned you about the accident.

698
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:43,206
When he realizes he can't change anything,

699
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:46,042
it will destroy him.

700
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,630
He'll fall into depression again.

701
00:52:57,303 --> 00:53:00,723
What happens to you
if he can't go back to 13 years ago?

702
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:03,017
Wouldn't that make you disappear?

703
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:04,685
Has that ever occurred to you?

704
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:11,359
Do you think I'll slowly vanish
into thin air or something?

705
00:53:12,777 --> 00:53:14,695
You've seen too many movies.

706
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:19,075
Plus...

707
00:53:22,745 --> 00:53:25,039
I actually wouldn't mind vanishing.

708
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:48,062
Help me.

709
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,356
It's my one last job.

710
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:57,572
Fine.

711
00:53:58,573 --> 00:53:59,448
I'll do it.

712
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,121
Thanks.

713
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:09,250
Fine. I'll be right back.

714
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:10,877
See you.

715
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:06,575
Be careful.

716
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:45,489
Uncle.

717
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,074
Are you okay?

718
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:51,078
Uncle!

719
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:04,550
That was scary.

720
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,219
It's been a while.

721
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:47,903
<i>Goodbye, Bok Gwi-ju.</i>

722
00:58:49,405 --> 00:58:52,450
<i>I wish you all the misery in the world.</i>

723
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:15,222
Are you okay?

724
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:17,766
Yeah.

725
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:20,352
Let's go.

726
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:41,749
<i>Hurry.</i>

727
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,461
<i>We have to find her
before the sauna lady does.</i>

728
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,736
Is that your family?

729
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:13,239
No.

730
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,657
Yes, they are.

731
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,118
No, they're not.

732
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:20,621
I'll never see them again.

733
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:22,998
You're lying.

734
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:27,670
You've been looking at them over and over

735
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,839
and over and over

736
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:38,180
and over and over again.

737
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:58,742
<i>You have missed your turn. Recalculating.</i>

738
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:12,840
Step on it.

739
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:14,717
We don't have all day.

740
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,028
{\an8}BED AND BREAKFAST

741
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,491
I knew you were her family.

742
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,327
What?

743
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:43,120
Are you here for the lady from Seoul?

744
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,747
Yes, where is she right now?

745
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:46,999
She's out on the beach.

746
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:49,209
Thanks.

747
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:52,713
Da-hae!

748
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:54,548
Do Da-hae!

749
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:57,176
Do Da-hae!

750
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,277
Do Da-hae!

751
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:21,408
Da-hae!

752
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:24,620
Da-hae!

753
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:27,623
Do Da-hae!

754
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,257
Gwi-ju isn't in his room.

755
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:38,634
He isn't?

756
01:02:39,802 --> 01:02:42,388
Is he at the river again?

757
01:02:42,388 --> 01:02:43,305
No.

758
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:49,228
Actually...

759
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,025
he went to find Ms. Da-hae.

760
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,945
- What?
- What do you mean?

761
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:00,197
He went to Da-hae?

762
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:05,994
She must've been hiding
from the sauna lady.

763
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:07,913
What are you talking about?

764
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,541
Are you saying she's alive?

765
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,167
How did he find out?

766
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:16,422
He went to the past and saw--

767
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:19,049
He went back to the past?
He couldn't have.

768
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,052
- He can't do that anymore.
- He's okay now.

769
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:23,887
And he'll bring Ms. Da-hae back.

770
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,474
- So don't worry--
- He can't do that.

771
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:29,476
This wasn't supposed to happen.

772
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,397
- Honey.
- Mom.

773
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:35,524
Are you okay, Grandma?

774
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,720
Da-hae.

775
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,641
Don't come near me.

776
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:14,855
- What?
- Why are you here?

777
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:17,191
What the hell are you doing here?

778
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,492
I could ask you the same thing.

779
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:28,911
I...

780
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,455
After you disappeared,

781
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:35,375
I searched everywhere for you.

782
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,127
How did you find me?

783
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:43,342
You've been alive the whole time.

784
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,886
Is this about Ms. Baek?

785
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:48,680
You should have just told me!

786
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:50,140
Did you...

787
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,937
manage to go back to the past?

788
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:56,271
What's going on?

789
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,690
Why did you pull something like this?

790
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:00,526
Why did you do this to me?

791
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:01,443
Because...

792
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:05,447
you're going to die.

793
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,411
Dad is...

794
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,458
going to die?

795
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:30,973
- What?
- So just go back.

796
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:32,808
You can't be with me!

797
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,519
You should be with I-na.

798
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:37,896
You promised you'd be there for her.

799
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:40,399
Go to her.

800
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:51,785
So you did this...

801
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,832
to stop me from going back to the past?

802
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:03,213
But this is a bit too cruel,
don't you think?

803
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,800
You know what I was like before I met you.

804
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,052
I can't go back to that.

805
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,015
Not after I've met you.

806
01:06:14,224 --> 01:06:15,517
I can't give this up.

807
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:19,354
You're the reason
I can breathe, walk, and run again.

808
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,732
I finally feel like myself.

809
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:25,903
How can I live on
when all that's taken away?

810
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,739
Can you even call that living?

811
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,576
I can't be there for I-na like that.

812
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:34,453
You're right.

813
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,664
I-na might just be an excuse.

814
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,460
I guess I'm just being selfish.

815
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:44,338
Even if you can't walk or run,

816
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,799
even if all you can do is breathe...

817
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:51,803
I just...

818
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:56,725
want you to be alive.

819
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,897
That's better than you being gone.

820
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:05,609
I don't think...

821
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:11,239
I can handle that.

822
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:19,164
I thought you were a clever scammer,

823
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:21,750
but you're an idiot.

824
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:25,462
Go.

825
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:27,798
Get away from me.

826
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:30,801
Go!

827
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:32,719
You're telling me to do what you can't.

828
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,641
I'm sorry, but I can't lose you either.

829
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,233
I won the bet.

830
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:48,860
Let me have my wish.

831
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,490
Bok Gwi-ju...

832
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:05,335
I love you.

833
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:27,899
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

834
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:58,430
{\an8}<i>I'm not done yet.</i>

835
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,308
{\an8}I'll find another way.
