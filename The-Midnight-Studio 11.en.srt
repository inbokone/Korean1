00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,120
I only did what you told me to do.

166
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

167
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,230
Kim Yoon Cheol. He didn't commit suicide.

168
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,040
He definitely had a wound on his neck.

169
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,270
But I skipped the autopsy because you said to close the case quickly.

170
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,500
I covered everything up for you. I did.

171
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
But how could you do this to me now? I won't go down alone.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,200
Is that why you threatened me by bringing up the opposition party chair?

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,550
What are you talking about right now? Because you keep trying to stay out of it-

174
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,360
You and I don't know each other.

175
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
That was the deal we made.

176
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,200
Don't you think I know you? You cut the tail off first when you're in danger.

177
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,820
You blamed a newbie prosecutor for

178
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,210
shoddy investigation for the vacation home murder case and kicked her out.

179
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,440
Go to the opposition party chair or the Prosecutors' Office.

180
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,700
Do whatever you want.

181
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,140
Whether it's the Kim Yoon Cheol case or the vacation home case,

182
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,090
you're the one who was directly involved. Don't you know?

183
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,290
Did you make me come here to threaten me?

184
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,330
This is how you threaten someone.

185
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,830
You don't just send some silly texts.

186
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,900
What texts?

187
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,550
Why is the car moving? What?

188
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,300
Minister!

189
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,670
Why is it suddenly moving?

190
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,030
Hey, grab the steering wheel. Do something!

191
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,370
Grab it! Do something!

192
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,840
Put the seat belt on.

193
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,980
Hey, hold it!

194
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,330
Grab it! Grab it! Grab it!

195
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,680
- Hurry up and grab the steering wheel!
- The steering wheel!

196
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,600
You might hurt yourself, gentlemen.

197
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Step on it, Mr. Baek!

198
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,300
H-How...

199
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,950
Why...

200
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,200
Wait...

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,740
How could this...

202
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,530
Well done, Mr. Baek.

203
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,670
I'll go home, then.

204
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,120
- Do you want to be driven around more?
- No...

205
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,600
What? Why isn't it opening?

206
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,060
(sign)

207
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,830
What do you want?

208
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,600
I left my phone here.

209
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,870
Where was it?

210
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,940
Oh, thank you.

211
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,370
Will you get out of this alone like an eel?

212
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,450
My life was ruined because of you.

213
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,230
What are you, exactly?

214
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,120
Are you a reporter? Prosecutor?

215
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Who do you work for?

216
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,070
I'm a photographer.

217
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,580
I work for Kim Yoon Cheol.

218
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,040
I don't know how you did it,

219
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,530
but tell me what you want.

220
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,530
Do you want to say hello?

221
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,560
Hold a press conference tomorrow.

222
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,090
Say there was an error in the investigation.

223
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,210
Say I definitely didn't commit suicide.

224
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,410
Yoon Cheol wants the truth, apparently.

225
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,220
The late Kim Yoon Cheol?

226
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,770
Whoever you are, you're trying to scare me by playing a ghost game.

227
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,670
What will you do with the voice recording? It can't be used in court.

228
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,810
I'm not a fool.

229
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,880
Why would I threaten the minister of justice with law?

230
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,970
But once this hits the press,

231
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,110
would people even care if it has legal power or not?

232
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,670
The scariest trial is the court of public opinion, Minister.

233
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,940
Jo Seong Tae and Kang Hyeong Il's safeguard.

234
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,300
It was you, wasn't it?

235
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,430
They told Mr. Kim not to worry since they have a safeguard.

236
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,490
But the question is,

237
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,070
why did someone influential like you protect them?

238
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,110
I was right, wasn't I?

239
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,680
Do you need money?

240
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,420
Everyone who knew the truth died

241
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,410
and you thought you just needed to cover up the case.

242
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,520
But death isn't necessarily the end.

243
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,850
The truths you thought you buried.

244
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,430
They will eventually come out in the open.

245
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,210
Because I, Yoon Cheol,

246
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,120
and the people who are helping him will make that happen.

247
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,150
Be careful at night.

248
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,410
There are many resentful ghosts.

249
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,970
Let's go, Yoon Cheol.

250
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,060
By the way, how did you know, Mr. Seo?

251
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,120
That Lee Hyeon Oh was their safeguard.

252
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,950
The secret back door was one of the clues.

253
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,030
The vacation home case was planned to make Mr. Kim the culprit.

254
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,730
That means someone tried to kill Kang Hyeong Il and Jo Seong Tae from the beginning.

255
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,610
It'd be difficult to find someone who resented them enough to kill them.

256
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,210
But who could've killed them, influenced the prosecution and police

257
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,600
to changed the culprit, and covered up the case entirely?

258
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,470
I know.

259
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,970
It's Lee Hyeon Oh, right?

260
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,360
That was my hunch, too.

261
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,440
What was their connection with Lee Hyeon Oh?

262
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,610
I tried imagining that scenario.

263
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,620
What if Lee Hyeon Oh was their safeguard?

264
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,120
I don't know why, but he suddenly had a reason to kill them.

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,390
If so, do you mean the minister was the real culprit?

266
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,380
He's not reckless enough to take such a huge risk.

267
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,410
- How did it go?
- We even got the voice recording.

268
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,230
Really? Are you okay? I should've gone with you.

269
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,130
Don't worry. I'll win.

270
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,520
I don't know if I should tell you this now.

271
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,950
- What is it?
- You know how

272
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,870
Mr. Seo doesn't know how to fight.

273
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,450
But he's able to argue...

274
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,430
Mr. Seo, I thought something was strange.

275
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:15,340
Did Attorney Han quit her job as a prosecutor because of me?

276
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,760
She got fired trying to help me, right?

277
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,680
Should we talk for a moment?

278
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,530
Here's the food you ordered.

279
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,780
Drink. Think of it as memorial service food.

280
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,660
Since you've been walking the death's path for three years,

281
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,020
you probably didn't get to have a proper meal.

282
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,600
Are you okay?

283
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,150
I'm okay.

284
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,570
I just got scratched a bit.

285
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,950
It's hard to control your body, isn't it?

286
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,670
It's hard to control anger, too.

287
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,490
Why is this h-happening to me?

288
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,890
You're becoming an evil spirit.

289
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,900
- Evil spirit?
- It will gradually become...

290
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,670
more difficult to control your emotions.

291
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,270
You'll eventually forget who you are and feel nothing but anger.

292
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,860
You won't be able to survive without hurting someone.

293
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,790
Why? I don't want to hurt anyone.

294
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,800
I just need to get my killer punished.

295
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,880
We call that deep resentment.

296
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,550
Because you had too much resentment when you were alive,

297
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,420
it will end up consuming you.

298
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,980
What should I do, then?

299
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,450
That's up to you, Yoon Cheol.

300
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,900
You know the person you met on the death's path?

301
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,740
The one who brought you here.

302
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,020
He's...

303
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,410
my uncle.

304
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,040
He was my only family whom I've been looking for 20 years.

305
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,800
I didn't know where he was trying to go to.

306
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,400
There was no way to know if...

307
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,420
he was dead or alive.

308
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,880
I realized he was dead when you came.

309
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,630
He didn't abandon me.

310
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,860
He must've had a situation.

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,130
It took me 20 years to realize that.

312
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,830
How much time would Yoon Hee need to accept your death?

313
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,550
You're the only person who could persuade her.

314
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,270
You asked me why Bom quit her job as a prosecutor.

315
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,720
She posted this on the internal bulletin board before you were released on bail.

316
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,180
Prosecutor Han Bom risked everything to help you then.

317
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,640
We'll make sure to catch the culprit.

318
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,750
Please have faith in Bom one more time.

319
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:56,460
You should think about what you want the most first.

320
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,410
To the fellow prosecutors I sincerely respect and love.

321
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,660
Written by a junior prosecutor with respect.

322
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,820
Even though there still was reasonable doubt,

323
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,970
I recently received a trial memo that clearly stated the defendant was guilty.

324
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,680
It is important to punish who is guilty,

325
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,310
but what's more important is to protect who's not.

326
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,470
If the prosecutor couldn't prove the defendant was guilty clearly,

327
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,900
the defendant's rights need to be protected.

328
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,320
Therefore, I request a reinvestigation for this case.

329
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,230
Will you get out of this alone like an eel?

330
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,240
My life was ruined because of you.

331
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,710
Try doing something.

332
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,960
An incompetent forever lieutenant.

333
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,820
"The prosecution happened too quickly.

334
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,790
There were a lot of questions about the case,

335
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,160
but instead of re investigating, I was pressured to close the case quickly.

336
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,020
It made me question my perception of the Prosecutors' Office

337
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,470
which I respected for its fairness and integrity."

338
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,600
Why didn't you mention my name, too?

339
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,400
That I pressured you to close the case quickly.

340
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,710
- I'm sorry.
- You told the reporters, too, right?

341
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,220
The defense attorney excitedly requested bail.

342
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,000
We're about to release a criminal now.

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,700
He's not a criminal yet. We should re investigate properly and-

344
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,900
Post an apology. Say it never happened.

345
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,100
That you got drunk and made a mistake.

346
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Let's just say it was a cheeky accident caused by a passionate newbie prosecutor.

347
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
- Sir.
- Take a break in the countryside for a few years.

348
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,500
Let's smile the next time we meet. Go.

349
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,450
If I doted on you with compliments, you should behave.

350
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,900
You'll keep insisting you're right, huh?

351
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,970
You think the Prosecutors' Office is a joke, right?

352
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,420
If you're insubordinate to the prosecution,

353
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,720
you won't get another case assigned to you.

354
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,670
Once you leave the prosecution, no matter where you are,

355
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,070
you won't get a single case.

356
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,920
You can't do anything if you leave now.

357
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,770
That's the fair and just organization I created.

358
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,310
Prosecutor Han,

359
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,100
go on with your shallow sense of justice.

360
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,040
I'll show you what power means.

361
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,900
You blamed a newbie prosecutor for

362
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,680
shoddy investigation for the vacation home murder case and kicked her out.

363
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,170
Go to the opposition party chair or Prosecutors' Office.

364
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,570
Do whatever you want.

365
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,020
[Safe Zone]

366
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,500
[Safe Zone]

367
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,200
Me?

368
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,630
What's this about?

369
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,610
I just thought you might need some consolation.

370
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,400
You're psychic.

371
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,750
Huh? What's this now?

372
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm complimenting you.

373
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,470
You did your best, Bom.

374
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,800
Thank you.

375
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,660
Right.

376
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,620
I finished listening to Lee Hyeon Oh's recording.

377
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,970
You left this at the studio, too.

378
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,250
By the way, why am I still "Safe Zone"?

379
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,690
Because you are the safe zone?

380
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm disappointed.

381
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,400
You still think of your only girlfriend as a ghost-repellent.

382
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,230
What should I say instead, then?

383
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,020
I don't know.

384
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,800
Think about it carefully.

385
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,300
With plenty of love and affection.

386
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,200
Oh, I know.

387
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,270
What is it?

388
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,830
"Safe Person."

389
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,960
What?

390
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,030
It would take another week to finish tidying up.

391
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,420
It's okay.

392
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,330
I've moved dozens of times. I can manage on my own.

393
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,880
Are you okay?

394
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Geez, I knew you overdid it.

395
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,230
Let's call it a day. You'll get sick.

396
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,700
Okay.

397
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,390
Let's stop for now.

398
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,500
By the way, should I put this in the storage?

399
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,100
Looks like it's Nam Goo's.

400
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,110
Give me that. I'll put it away tomorrow.

401
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,800
Let's go.

402
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,600
Our stuff is...

403
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,840
nothing but...

404
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,680
a burden to you now.

405
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,820
(sign)

406
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Wedding vows.

407
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,000
I take a vow in front of everyone as I accept you as my wife.

408
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,570
No matter how busy I am, I'll talk to you while making eye contact for at least 30 minutes a day.

409
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,100
I'll pick up your favorite flowers four times a year on the way home.

410
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,600
The party favors for the guests and the host's script are ready.
[7 Years Ago]

411
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,240
Oppa, this is the seat arrangement for the guests.

412
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,410
How should we seat the detectives...

413
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,900
Gosh, I'm sorry. My gosh.

414
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,190
What's wrong with me?

415
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,580
Where were we, Honey?

416
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,070
You catch all the criminals in Korea, don't you?

417
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,120
Are you the only detective they have?

418
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,640
Detective Go was stabbed recently.

419
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,110
I'm the only substitute they've got.

420
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,360
Why do detectives get stabbed all the time? What are you, thugs?

421
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,950
Would you have time to get married at this rate?

422
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:47,140
Of course. I'll marry you even if the Earth comes to an end.

423
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,200
I'll take care of everything else, but you have to do this.

424
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Got it. I'll fill out the pages.

425
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,540
We'll break the engagement if you can't even do this.

426
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,670
Yes, sir.

427
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,000
- Don't look.
- I won't.

428
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,140
We'll take a trip once a year.

429
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,700
We'll travel all around the world by the time our hair turns gray.

430
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,100
I won't make my wife lonely because I'm busy.

431
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,890
We sincerely promise to only look at each other, cherish each other,

432
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,100
and live happily for the rest of our lives.

433
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,700
After all these promises...

434
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,050
It's a photo studio now?

435
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,800
Why?

436
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,060
Is my brother lingering in this world because he's been wronged?

437
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,340
Yes.

438
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,240
You should've come up with a new story, at least.

439
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know what to tell you. You chose the wrong person.

440
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,270
We no longer have money to pay.

441
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,170
My mom has been fooled and gave away all the money to people like you.

442
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,800
I'll call the police if you come back.

443

Yoon Cheol stole first when you were in high school, right?

444
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,470
He stole 157,000 won to let you go on a school trip.

445
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,400
He tried to prepare your wedding gifts this time.

446
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,030
He didn't want your fiance's family to look down on you for being an ex-con's family.

447
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:25,230
That's why he couldn't keep his promise not to steal anymore.

448
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,000
He wants to tell you something for one last time.

449

Even though she knows it's a scam.

462

It always bothered me that he never had proper clothes.

He must be very cold. Would I be able to dress him?

00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,690
but I couldn't even help you.

489
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:08,340
Instead, I ruined my little sister's life.

490
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,210
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

491
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,400
What are you talking about?

492
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,740
I'm the one who broke the engagement.

493
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,670
He's been looking down on our family since we were dating.

494
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,030
It's not your fault. It was bound to end, anyway.

495
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,420
Is that why you couldn't leave?

496
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,750
I knew you and Mom would've suffered forever if I didn't tell you.

Let's go.

527
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,770
Excuse me, Attorney.

528
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,040
Yes.

529
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,780
You said you were Oppa's prosecutor, right?

530
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,410
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,010
I shouldn't have given up easily then.

532
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,390
I'm not trying to blame you.

533
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,270
I promised my brother that I would clear his name.

534
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,430
But I'm not sure what to do.

535
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,810
I didn't notice before, but looking at these now,

536
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,710
everyone looks sad.

537
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,660
None of us were supposed to be born.

538
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,090
Stealing a camera saved someone who was about to die.

539
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:22,150
And we were cursed not to live past 35 for committing that sin.

540
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,160
Could I have a look at that seal, by chance?

541
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,010
They look exactly the same.

542
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,830
I got this scar after the accident. I didn't have it before.

543
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,580
So maybe your uncle had this seal.

544
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,370
I came here with the camera, too.

545
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,770
Maybe I was able to keep on living because of this seal.

546
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,480
I did think that could be possible, but-

547
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,220
But you couldn't ask because I didn't remember, right?

548
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,640
Because it's a traumatic memory.

549
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,750
I didn't want to force you to remember.

550
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,380
But I'll try to remember it.

551
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,820
Maybe my memory can help lift your curse.

552
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,760
Don't try too hard.

553
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,590
I'm trying to figure out a way, too.

554
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,820
Ji Won.

555
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,540
You're finally returning home.

556
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,700
Why does she keep working at night?

557
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,840
Is she hiding something in the studio?

558
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,530
They've been on dates pretending to be working every night.

559
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,330
There was a reason why she was distant from her only roommate.

560
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,160
Come on. They're not like that.

561
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,310
They're more like under an agreement out of need.

562
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,080
Look. Look. Look. They must be dating.

563
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,370
I bet they already kissed, too.

564
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,330
It's not like that, I said.

565
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,270
You're teasing a single lady too much.

566
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,400
I'll do it, too. I'll go on a blind date.

567
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,180
Blind date?

568
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,300

You said you'll find a way. Is this a part of it?

584
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,500
I thought you hated working out.

585
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,810
I do. Very much.

586
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,500
But I promised you...

587
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,110
to live the best way I can.

588
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,590
It'd be too difficult to fight an evil spirit

589
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,620
if I run into one outside again.

590
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
I need to run faster than I do now.

591
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,000
That way, I can lead them toward the studio.

592
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,540
Lead them toward the studio?

593
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,350
I've been thinking about a way to survive.

594
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:30,430
There are three things that set me apart from other photographers.

595
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,520
It's that I have you, Deputy Go, and Mr. Baek.

596
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,280
I'll use that to lure the evil spirits to the studio.

597
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,920
While the studio protects me,

598
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,570
and Deputy Go, Mr. Baek, and the Safe Zone help me,

599
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,710
I'll expel all the evil spirits.

600
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:54,000
But you haven't tried it when you knew how to do it?

601
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Because I didn't want to try all my might to keep living.

602
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,770
I just wanted to die a little less miserably.

603
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,730
That's all I wanted.

604
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,020
But not anymore.

605
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,210
I need the Safe Zone.

606
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,830
I need you, Bom.

Two million 990,000 won? Are you crazy...

Hey! I've never worn that brand's clothes my whole life.

613
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,410
I've been working...

614
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,450
for three years without pay or vacation. You can at least buy me this!

615
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,170
I've been providing food and lodging for three years!

616
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,830
Go return it right now.

617
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,520
I already burnt it.

618
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,330
What kind of ghost burns clothes on his own?

619
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,250
Deputy Go, I almost didn't recognize you.

620
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,280
Wow, is this that suit?

621
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,960
- Yes.
- He bought it using my card.

622
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,030
I see. It suits you very well. You look great.

623
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:32,640
I knew you had good taste. Unlike someone.

624
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,810
- By the way, Ms. Han.
- Yes.

625
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,120
When does your friend come home-

626
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,540
Ji Won?

627
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,140
I don't know. She said she'd be late because of a work dinner.

628
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,620
Pardon?

629
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,960
Chief, I can't find a driver.

630
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,930
Try a different app. Different app.

631
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,160
Intern. Yes.

632
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,820
You're going to have to drive for me tonight.

633
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,400
I chose you as my driver.

634
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,750
I'll be heading home now.

635
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,060
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hey. Hey.

636
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,540
Hey! You little...

637
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,040
This is why you can't hire sick people.

638
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,700
You said you had cancer, right?

639
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,330
What stage are you in?

640
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,480
What stage cancer do you have?

641
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,780
You don't get things done quickly.

642
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,750
You're an intern, but you take a vacation every chance you get.

643
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,410
You can't drink because you're sick.

644
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,280
You should drive for me, at least, then.

645
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,370
Don't you want to keep your job?

646
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,740
Who... Shit...

647
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,470
Kim Jeong Soo, you little...

648
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,930
No, no, no! Stop!

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,490

A connection between Lee Hyeon Oh and the two victims.

813
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,600
We don't know why, but I think he started being

814
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,740
their safeguard since the Jangjin Tunnel accident.

815
00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:00,070

from 20 years ago would be connected.

822

Lee Hyeon Oh and Attorney Han really were sworn enemies.

Shouldn't we go with her?

It must be hard for Ms. Han.

I'll try to locate Kim Seong Soo first.

828

We need to find him to get a clue for the vacation home case.

I'll go to the Jangjin Tunnel.
