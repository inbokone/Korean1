164
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,820
Give up, still. You need to.

165
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,690
You'd only hurt yourself if you don't.

166
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,590
Who's that? Why is she at our house?

167
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,050
Is it because of me...

168
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,200
And w-why are you here?

169
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,870
You said you were getting married!

170
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,260
Were you not able to because I died, by chance?

171
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,770
Is that it?

172
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
The breakfast is ready.

173
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,810
Please say something.

174
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,540
Mom, you know you're going to the hospital today, right?

175
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,160
You need to go this time.

176
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,380
That's enough now.

177
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,800
When will you stop preparing meals for Oppa?

178
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,640
He left us behind. What's so great about him?

179
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,900
I don't even want to see him in my dreams.

180
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,570
- Where's your husband?
- What husband?

181
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,390
It's already been three years since we broke up.

182
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,570
It's my fault.

183
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,400
Because of me...

184
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,330
Hold on.

185
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,830
I didn't do anything wrong. Why am I hiding?

186
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,910
I'm a ghost.

187
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,320
Why am I doing this even after I died?

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,030
Deputy Go.

189
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,230
Oh, M-M-Ms. Han.

190
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,740
Why are you following me so obviously?

191
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,130
Mr. Seo made you to keep me safe, right?

192
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,960
T-That's a secret man to man-

193
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,050
I know what happened at the studio.

194
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,930
D-Don't worry.

195
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,600
Kim Yoon Cheol would never come to see you.

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,450
Mr. Seo said he'd take care of it.

197
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,640
- Who did you say it was?
- Gosh, but...

198
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,940
what made you trust a murderer who killed two people?

199
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,270
Did you say Kim Yoon Cheol just now?

200
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,030
Kim Yoon Cheol, the suspect in the Vacation Home murders?

201
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,570
Pardon?

202
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,010
Y-You said you knew everything.

203
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,020
What?

204
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,130
You got the wedding invitation, right?

205
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,930
I wanted to be congratulated by you in person.

206
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,200
What's that bastard doing right now?

207
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
If we got married back then, I almost became the murderer's family, too.

208
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,890
My mom said our ancestors helped us dodge the bullet.

209
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,730
You're so unbelievable, too.

210
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,410
How could you keep working at the same company as me?

211
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,800
Why do I have to quit?

212
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,330
Of course, you have to.

213
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,930
Your brother is a murderer who killed two people.

214
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,850
Seo Joon...

215
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,370
Congrats on your wedding, but don't be so cruel.

216
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,820
My brother never would've killed someone.

217
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,910
He was an ex-con.

218
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,080
Who says a thief can't kill?

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,780
But I guess he had a conscience, at least.

220
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,200
He committed suicide because of it, right?

221
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,080
Suicide?

222
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,360
I committed suicide?

223
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,390
Suicide? No way.

224
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,500
I wish you a miserable life, Yoon Hee.

225
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,690
- How could I've committed suicide?
- Thinking of me all your life...

226
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,820
No, Yoon Hee. You believe me, right?

227
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,840
Even your murdering brother knows how to repent.

228
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,190
Thank you for congratulating me. I'll leave now.

229
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,410
(sign)

230
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,600
[I will help you in a moment]

231
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,230
Did Ms. Kim Yoon Hee go somewhere by chance?

232
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,780
Deputy Kim stepped out for a second.

233
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,720
I'll kill you.

234
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,340
You don't know?

235
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,910
Gosh, what was that? An earthquake?

236
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,860
Gosh, what's going on?

237
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,890
We found him. Kim Yoon Cheol.

238
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,590
[Kim Yoon Hee]

239
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,470
Gosh, what do I do? What do I do?

240
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,700
What do I do?

241
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,110
I'll kill you.

242
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,770
That's enough.

243
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,280
Let go of me. I'll kill this bastard.

244
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,300
He promised to make Yoon Hee happy. How could he?

245
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,380
- How could he!
- Go to the first floor right now.

246
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay.

247
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,360
Where are you going?

248
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,160
You said you didn't kill. You said it wasn't true.

249
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,640
If you kill him, you'll become a murderer for real.

250
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,540
I thought you granted desperate wishes.

251
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,250
Find the bastard who killed me.

252
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,570
The bastard who killed me and my friends.

253
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,010
Bring him in front of me so I could kill him.

254
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,090
Can you do that?

255
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,960
If you can't, get out of my face!

256
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
Mr. Kim.

257
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,890
Ms. Han, go downstairs right now!

258
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,930
Prosecutor Han?

259
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,660
It's been a while, hasn't it?

260
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,640
What are you doing here?

261
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,810
Did you forget your promise to me?

262
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,930
Kim Yoon Cheol's fingerprints weren't found on the evidence found in his car.

263
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,490
He must've removed them.

264
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,790
He has two previous convictions. He runs a cleaning service, too.

265
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,280
He's clever enough to do that.

266
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,850
But the autopsy reports for the victims haven't come out yet.

267
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,980
Prosecuting him now would be problematic.

268
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,390
He was the only one who left the crime scene.

269
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,290
There's CCTV footage to prove that, too.

270
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,960
It doesn't seem unreasonable to prosecute him.

271
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,400
But it's impossible to kill two adult men in five minutes, sir.

272
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
And they have assault records, too.

273
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
They aren't just ordinary people.

274
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,080
We need to re investigate this from the beginning.

275
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,420
Can I really be released?

276
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,720
Can I go to Yoon Hee's wedding?

277
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,410
Yes.

278
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,150
But this is just a conditional discharge.

279
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,450
It doesn't mean you were acquitted.

280
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,150
You can't cause any trouble before the trial, okay?

281
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,980
Okay. Thank you.

282
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,680
Thank you, Prosecutor.

283
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,000
It doesn't mean I trust you.

284
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,350
But what you said is true.

285
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,510
A prosecutor should only punish according to the crime.

286
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,380
We can't frame an innocent person.

287
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,880
Yes.

288
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,380
Thank you.

289
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,440
I'll re investigate it thoroughly after you come back from the wedding. I warned you.

290
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,770
I'm not an easy person.

291
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,340
Okay.

292
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,430
I... I didn't commit suicide.

293
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,030
I swear I didn't.

294
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,490
Please believe me.

295
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,440
Thank you.

296
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,580
Hello. I'll also have a regular coffee today.

297
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,400
- Which coffee?
- Come on.

298
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,550
The one you made last time. The sweet one.

299
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,240
Chief Kim is flipping out- I mean, angry again today.

300
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,730
I need to have my fill of sugar urgently.

301
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,600
Ma'am, could you tell me the name of the drink you want?

302
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh, well...

303
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,250
I'll just have two iced Americanos.

304
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,720
Oh, I don't need them delivered today. I'll drink them here.

305
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,310
Ma'am, we don't ever provide delivery service.

306
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,510
He definitely delivered last time.

307
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,490
Does it depend on his mood?

308
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,480
Do you find the part-timer handsome?

309
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,650
- Eun Mi sunbae.
- You never give any warning.

310
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,900
You quit your good job to suddenly travel around the world.

311
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,250
Now you're back in Korea and have a job?

312
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,800
In the building next to ours?

313
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,600
You're really full of surprises.

314
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,980
I have been delighting and surprising everyone.

315
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,240
Do you want to go on a blind date since you're back?

316
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,770
I know a few good candidates.

317
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,530
I'm traumatized because of the one you set me up with.

318
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,570
I don't like Hyun Bin because of him.

319
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,680
Because he suggested watching "Crash Landing on You" together.

320
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,180
And he stopped contacting me the next day.

321
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,020
Why did he reject me, exactly?

322
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,660
Does he not like my looks? My personality?

323
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,960
I see. Because my family isn't wealthy?

324
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,200
Why won't you say anything?

325
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,190

Mr. Seo, do you want to be reported for trespassing?

The two of them were lying down here like this.

502
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,340
Kang Yeong Il and Jo Seong Tae both had three critical wounds

503

and they were all caused by a blunt tool.

By the way, isn't it kind of strange?

Kim Yoon Cheol stayed in here less than five minutes,

506

507
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,340
I was wondering about that, too.

508

As if someone had killed them before and tried to frame Mr. Kim for it.

509

But there was no sign of anyone but the three of them on the CCTV.

That's why Kim Yoon Cheol was the perfect suspect.

I thought there was only one door.

529
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,520
By the way, there's no CCTV here.

530
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,430
The culprit must've taken this path and used the back door.

531

If so, as Mr. Kim said,

532

546
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,760
there was a door to the backyard at the back of the kitchen.

547
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,390
That information was left out in the case report I received.

548

and got scouted by the Kang Il Goo Law Firm, too.
