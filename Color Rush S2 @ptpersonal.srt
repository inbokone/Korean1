Go Yoo Han got kidnapped trying to save me.

I've been friends with Go Yoo Han since elementary school.

Why would you?

15
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:02,827
Because he's a thoughtless bastard.

16

Why would you think that?

17
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,327
I mean, how could he leave you here, by yourself,

and leave for the U.S. alone.

19

that Go Yoo Han was kidnapped right before my eyes.

It seems this list has names from a certain site relating to Monos.

It was reported that some people run a blog or SNS.

00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:52,582
I think I'll go deaf if I use these earphones that a dirty person like you touched.

163
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,622
Your kind obsesses over your Probes, kidnaps them, and even kills them.

164
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:01,322
Oh, right. This was even on the news yesterday.

165
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:04,022
It also involved cannibalism this time, too.

166
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:07,542
Tell me. Who's the Mono, your mom or dad?

167
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,042
They don't try and kill each other?

168
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,600
How could she hit my child?

169
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,780
My child is precious!

170
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,290
Umm... Jin Sung's mother. Please calm down.

171
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,890
Do you really think I calm down?

172
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,930
When that small girl hit my son.

173
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,090
(Jin Sung's) Mother. It seems Jin Sung said

174
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,080
some harsh words to Ye Won.
- I see.

175
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,740
But does that justify the use of violence?

176
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,110
Does this school only care about the defendant and not the victim?

177
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,620
I will report this to the media and the police too.

178
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,700
That a Mono hit a person!

179
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,660
(Jin Sung's) Mother. Isn't there a way we can peacefully solve this?

180
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,800
I don't want to resolve this peacefully.

181
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,420
Disgruntled person.

182
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,640
What? Did you hear that?

183
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,440
She's not apologizing although she hit someone.

184
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,830
(Jin Sung's) Mother. Please calm down a little.

185
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,230
You should at least apologize for saying harsh words to your friend, Jin Sung.

186
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,884
Who's her friend?

187
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,534
She's a total loner.

188
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:29,014
You. Who's the closest person to you in your class?

189
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:37,574
Also... where is your guardian?

190
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:39,894
Why are you sitting here alone?

191
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:42,034
Where are your parents?

192
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:46,214
You people seriously have no manners! Even after hitting a person!

193
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,594
Jin Sung's mother. Should I call Ye Won's guardian?

194
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:52,594
Yes. Please call them right now.

195
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:55,494
I can't right now because they're in class.

196
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:57,144
So...

197
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,234
Her guardian is a teacher?

198
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:05,324
No. She has an uncle, but he hasn't returned from the sea.

199
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:10,324
She has a brother named Kim Se Hyun, who attends SangSang High School across the street.

200
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:13,134
So, it's a bit difficult right now.

201
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:16,044
Then at least have the student come here right now.

202
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,734
No, Mom.

203
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,014
Let's just go.

204
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:23,064
- What?
- Please, let's just go.

205
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,854
Are you serious?

206
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:28,374
Why are you acting like this? We can't leave without an apology.

207
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:30,784
No, Mom! I might get killed.

208
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,824
Kim Se Hyun's shadow boxing.

209
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,624
Even the neighborhood bullies avoid him!

210
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:38,034
What is this kid saying?

211
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:40,444
Ye Won, I'm sorry.

212
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,154
I didn't know you're Kim Se Hyun's younger sister.

213
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,174
You've never talked about your family.

214
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,994
If I knew, I wouldn't have done this. I'm really sorry.

215
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:50,674
Please don't tell him, okay?

216
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,824
I'm sorry for making fun of you.

217
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:56,924
I beg you.

218
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,164
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,854
Hey! You get up right now!

220
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,244
Why are you the one who's on his knees begging?!

221
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,744
- Let's go, please!
- Why are you acting like this?

222
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:08,144
Let's go, please!

223
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,184
Let's go, Mom.

224
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,834
Since this is a problem between the students,

225
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,754
I ask you to educate her properly as the homeroom teacher. Do you understand?

226
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:18,964
Yes, I understand.

227
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,524
Let go!

228
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,354
Go to the nurse's office.

229
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,454
Okay.

230
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,384
Also, about your older brother...

231
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,724
I won't tell.

232
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:59,124
Class President, did you order the pizza you promised to treat the class?

233
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,934
- Yes. You saw the bill yesterday, right?
- Yeah.

234
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:04,134
It's expensive with the drinks.

235
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:07,654
But still, we have to order that much to eat our fill.

236
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,934
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,494
Do you... want to join us for soccer?

238
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,084
What?

239
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:40,234
Joo Haeng and I are going to the library.

240
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:47,664
There are an odd number of people, so we need one more person.

241
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:49,424
Is he going to play or not?

242
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,474
He's going to.

243
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:53,034
Okay.

244
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:56,154
Let's go. When you have a lot on your mind, playing soccer helps.

245
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,694
I have a lot of on my mind?

246
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:01,234
How did he know?

247
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:04,984
Here. I brought one for you just in case.

248
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,814
Change and come out.

249
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,394
Over here, here, here! Pass, pass!

250
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,864
- Yeon Woo pass!
- Yeon Woo, here! Here!

251
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,354
Here! Here!

252
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:23,324
What? Why are you so good?

253
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:26,514
Wow!

254
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,264
That was pretty cool, Choi Yeon Woo.

255
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,894
- Let's go!
- I didn't know then.

256
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:35,124
- Let's win this game!
- That I laughed for the first time in half a year.

257
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:44,544
Strangely, I was sleepy as soon as I got home.

258
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:46,530
Is it because I ran for the first time in a while?

259
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,700
I fell asleep when it wasn't even six yet.

260
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:23,054
Help me. I need to be the best employee.

261
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:30,934
You're a Mono, right?

262
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,774
Let's make candies together.

263
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,964
You can get the Probe surgery if you make a lot of these.

264
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:38,314
Probe surgery?

265
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:43,524
With that, you can see colors without a Probe.

266
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,574
But truthfully…

267
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,374
A young girl appeared in my dreams.

268
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:59,224
A face that I may or may not have seen before.

269
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:04,374
I can see colors without a Probe... What does that mean?

270
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:10,894
The girl's anxiety and fear seemed too realistic for it to be a dream.

271
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:14,234
This is not the time to think about dreams.

272
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:18,554
Last night, I searched all the nicknames and IDs on the list

273
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,454
and was able to find a trace.

274
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:27,944
[Gray Scale]
[Buy Children's item for MONO]

275
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:33,904
Traces were left by the user "Monowife" when they were promoting group purchases.

276
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:37,724
If this person is still using the same number...

277
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:41,724
[Buy Children's item for MONO]

278
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,084
Hello?

279
00:21:56,104 --> 00:22:00,184
Hello. My name is Choi Yeon Woo, a second-year at SangSang High School.

280
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,444
High school?

281
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,084
Yes.

282
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:07,014
By any chance, do you know my mother, Yoo Yi Ri?

283
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:09,634
Oh, Yoo Yi Ri unnie?

284
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,424
Like I told PD Yoo Yi Rang on the phone,

285
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:17,314
I have nothing else to tell you. I'm sorry.

286
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:22,104
If she had already talked with my aunt on the phone, then my aunt knew everything.

287
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:25,084
Ah, that makes things difficult.
[Aunt]

288
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,884
Yeah.

289
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:31,734
Hey, Choi Yeon Woo.

290
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:35,364
How did you contact Kim Hyun Joo?

291
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:38,394
That person's name must've been Kim Hyun Joo.

292
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:43,064
She seems close to my aunt since she called her soon after we talked.

293
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:46,154
I told you to stop looking for my sister. Didn't I?

294
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:48,114
You're not telling me anything.

295
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,634
I'll tell you when everything is done. I promise.

296
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,424
And when will that be?

297
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:55,274
Do you really want your phone taken away?

298
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,514
It's more of a disadvantage for you, not me, since you can't contact me.

299
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:01,024
How can you resemble your mom so much?

300
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,194
Of course, I'll resemble her.

301
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:07,934
Using someone's affection to threaten them is exactly the same.

302
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:23,524
Aunt, I'm sorry. It's because I am immature and young.

303
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:27,664
I know that you worry when you can't reach me.

304
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:30,744
I spoke harshly because I lost my temper.

305
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:36,404
[Aunt, I'm sorry. It's because I am immature and young.]

[I spoke harshly because I lost my temper.]

306
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:39,964
I found a mono café called Gray Scale.

307
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:43,684
After finding out that mom was attending a café gathering at this location six years ago,

308
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:46,014
I just wanted to be some help...

309
00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:48,014
I was being greedy.

310
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:49,750
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:59,754

313
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,834
That's so like her.

314
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:15,144
Aunt wants me to no longer get involved in this matter

315
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:20,864
and wait. Like she said, poking my nose in

316
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:24,090
might interfere with her investigation.

00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,720
[Okay!]

321
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:56,234
It felt like time had stopped.

322
00:24:56,234 --> 00:25:00,754
My time lingered at that day and time.

323
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:05,814
It was empty, just like those days Go Yoo Han wasn't at the playground.

324
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:12,254
I could no longer hear his endearing voice that told me what color the sand was.

325
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:16,444
But I was just lost in thought

326
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:20,284
of what I can and should do.

327
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:24,024
[Aunt]

328
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,694
Yeah?

329
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,384
Yeon Woo, where are you right now?

330
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:31,394
I just got home.

331
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:33,474
If so...

332
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,934
- Can you go to a funeral on my behalf?
- Did you search here?

333
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,524
Can you reach the bereaved family?

334
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:40,144
Funeral?

335
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:43,434
Yes. I have to attend, but I don't think I can make it.

336
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,764
Who is it for that I have to go?

337
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:48,604
Isn't it better if someone else you know goes?

338
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:53,434
I didn't want to go to a funeral. It was the place I saw my mother...

339
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:56,884
the most broken for three days after my

340
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:59,544
sick father passed away.

341
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,034
It's Kim Hyun Joo.

342
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,434
"Monowife"?

343
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:09,804
Yes. She's a bit upset. So send her my apology and leave after the meal.

344
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:14,134
The deceased must be associated with my mom's disappearance.

345
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:18,234
If not, then there is no reason for "Monowife" to appear.

346
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:21,180
She needs to remain in contact with her, even if she has to send me,

347
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,944
so she can question her later.

348
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:27,804
Who is the deceased? Are they one of the missing people?

349
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,764
Okay, I'll be tactful when I'm there.

350
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:33,654
I transferred the condolence money to your bank account, and I'll send you the address.

351
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:35,414
Okay.

352
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:45,044
There was one phrase that I heard more clearly than the other words. "The bereaved family..."

353
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:50,404
I was tied to the phrase, "the bereaved family," for a long time, and it made me dwell on it several times.

354
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:56,554
[Room 1 / Deceased: Kim Ye Won / Brother: Kim Se Hyun]

355
00:26:56,554 --> 00:27:01,384
Goodness. Yoo Yi Ri unnie is pretty and so is her son.

356
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:04,814
- Hello.
- You are Choi Yeon Woo, right?

357
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:08,264
Kids these days grow up so fast.

358
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:11,194
We never met, but she talked as if we met when I was young.

359
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:14,020
I have no memory of her.

360
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:19,024
I was worried about you coming on behalf of PD Yoo Yi Rang.

361
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:23,314
I guess you can't hide your genes. How are you so pretty?

362
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:28,174
I'm sorry for thoughtlessly calling you back then.

363
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:32,434
Why are you apologizing for that? I'm all right.

364
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:35,934
Yeon Woo, have you been to a funeral?

365
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,904
Yes.

366
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:46,594
There was no need for me to tell her that it was when my father passed away.

367
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:04,544
It was the girl I saw in my dream.

368
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,904
Ye Won was a bright child,

369
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,434
so she'll be fine in the afterlife.

370
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:19,614
Yes, thank you.

371
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:29,684
He's the son of the person whom Ye Won looked up to.

372
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:37,544
I see.

373
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:46,414
Thank you for coming.

374
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:07,715
This is Yoo Yi Ri's son.

375
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:11,115
- Hello.
- Hello.

376
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,835
How do these people know Mom?

377
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:20,025
Choi Yeon Woo, you're also a Mono?

378
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,105
Yes.

379
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,205
...also?

380
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:29,275
Then... does that mean there is another Mono among these people?

381
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:32,715
Then, what about your Probe?

382
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:42,425
Ye Won looked up to Yi Ri quite a lot.

383
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:45,745
We were all members of an online café.

384
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:49,365
Those were the days.

385
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:53,215
- But we couldn't meet up often because I moved to Pohang.
-That's right.

386
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:58,265
That's not the problem right now. Shouldn't we prevent Probe surgery from happening?

387
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,105
What do you all think?

388
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:03,145
Probe surgery?

389
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:07,205
They said it was due to infection.

390
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,265
Apparently, they open your skull for both insertion and removal of a probe.

391
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:15,255
She was so happy about the thought of seeing colors after surgery.

392
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:18,635
- But we should have stopped them.
- We should've.

393
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:22,745
It is rumored that long ago, at a laboratory, a Mono temporarily experienced a color rush

394
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:26,065
after an electric stimulation was sent to the brain with a probe.

395
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:32,715
A surgery that stimulates Mono to recognize colors. That's Probe surgery.

396
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:36,835
But I can't believe such surgery exists.

397
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:42,385
Ye Won didn't have a Probe,

398
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:46,325
so she was very envious of Yi Ri since she met hers.

399
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:51,605
I believe she said it was the love of a century or something.

400
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:53,295
I see...

401
00:30:55,195 --> 00:31:00,165
She went through a lot of hardship at such a young age because she suddenly became the administrator.

402
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,855
Administrator?

403
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:06,605
Yes. Ye Won is Dododok, the administrator of our café.

404
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:11,085
The girl in my dream and in that picture

405
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:14,265
was the administrator? And she was Dododok?

406
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:18,125
She went through surgery hoping for a "Probe".

407
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,825
No matter what, Yeon Woo, you shouldn't do it.

408
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:25,175
Seeing colors isn't as amazing as you think. You understand?

409
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:29,845
From what I hear, there are unapproved drugs. So don't do the surgery.

410
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:31,865
Unapproved drugs?

411
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:37,935
Oh my, look at the time.

412
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:49,715
- You're not leaving?
- Yes. I'll leave a little later.

413
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:52,435
Okay, then. We'll leave first.

414
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:10,435
I'll do this, so take your place.

415
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:14,805
Thanks.

416
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:37,215
[The deceased, Kim Ye Won.]

417
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,025
Why did you pretend not to know me?

418
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:49,995
Just because... I didn't want those people to know that I knew you.

419
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:52,295
Who were those people?

420
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,335
I didn't call anyone.

421
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:13,085
Who would be sad over a Mono's death?

422
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:18,685
In fact, they would be happy that a risk factor has disappeared.

423
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,655
But, still...

424
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:23,055
I notified my younger sister's school

425
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:29,205
because there might be someone who misses Ye Won.

426
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:33,995
Her homeroom teacher will probably bring them tomorrow.

427
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,465
I think that's all there is to it.

428
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:43,225
- What about the pallbearing?
- I can do it alone.

429
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:49,355
Such bitter words. How can he say he'll do it alone?

430
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:52,265
Don't tell anyone at school about this.

431
00:33:52,265 --> 00:33:56,345
I don't want them to know about this.

432
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:08,535
Yeah. I'll leave after helping him with the pallbearing.

433
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:15,935
I'm all right. Let's talk later. Okay.

434
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:30,065
There's no need.

435
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:33,955
I'm not doing it for you.

436
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,535
I'm doing it because your younger sister appeared in my dream.

437
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,855
Why would my younger sister appear in your dream?

438
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,795
If she was to, then she should appear in my dreams.

439
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,195
I'm her older brother. Not you.

440
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:54,605
Why are you asking me? Ask your sister.

441
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:03,365
I just find it fascinating... and welcoming.

442
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:07,305
I didn't know my younger sister would work at a candy factory.

443
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,975
What did you say she said?

444
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:11,965
She said that she wanted to be the best employee.

445
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,405
The best employee...

446
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,515
I don't know what that means.

447
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,665
I just don't understand.

448
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:26,315
Why did she appear in your dream and talk nonsense?

449
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:32,935
What was she trying to say at the end?

450
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:41,575
[The deceased, Kim Ye Won.]

451
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:02,305
Se Hyun's younger sister became a small tree on a hill overlooking the ocean.

452
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:04,155
Thanks.

453
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:09,195
Why are you laughing?

454
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:16,935
I thought there wouldn't be any more ties between you and me.

455
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:21,015
What's this "between you and me" and "ties"?

456
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:28,025
I saw you a lot at school.

457
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:32,855
I wanted to get closer to you, but you would only play with him.

458
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:36,595
I didn't like how I felt.

459
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:39,035
What are you suddenly trying to start?

460
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,835
You want to find your mom and Go Yoo Han, right?

461
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:48,195
Isn't that why you came to the funeral?

462
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:53,475
My aunt told me to go on her behalf, and you were there.

463
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:57,215
And you had a meal with "Monowife."

464
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,515
Do you know what that means?

465
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:11,735
You have become their subject of interest.

466
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:13,125
What?

467
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:15,915
You're Yoo Yi Ri's son.

468
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:19,755
Then, PD Yoo Yi Rang is your aunt.

469
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,985
Is it a crime that my aunt is a PD?

470
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:32,185
I, too, don't really know who they are and what they do.

471
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:35,515
But I know one thing.

472
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:39,035
The person they hate most.

473
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:43,665
The tenacious and persistent person tailing them,

474
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:48,745
reporter Yoo Yi Rang of "Searching for the truth." Your aunt.

475
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:53,005
My aunt... just wants to find my mom.

476
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:55,085
Your aunt is a PD.

477
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:58,385
She could destroy them with one broadcast.

478
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,075
It's always like that.

479
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:04,305
You are Yoo Yi Rang's only weakness,

480
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:07,095
her one and only nephew,

481
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,655
and a Mono, Choi Yeon Woo.

482
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,365
Yoo Yi Rang probably can't do anything because of you.

483
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:18,645
Come to think of it, they may have known about you beforehand,

484
00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:22,815
and Go Yoo Han was kidnapped instead of you.

485
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:27,605
Be careful of what you say. What do you mean, kidnapped instead of me?

486
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:37,595
You're the first to not get hit for grabbing my collar.

487
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,555
I'm sorry, but

488
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:43,485
I'm only curious about my mom's and Go Yoo Han's disappearance.

489
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:46,915
Okay.

490
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,009
Then trust me and keep pushing forward.

491
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,490
I'm going to protect you.

492
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,810
What do you mean?

493
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,615
I used to live here with my grandma.

494
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:28,575
But after my grandma passed away, my uncle got on a boat saying he was going to make some money

495
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,735
and hasn't come back.

496
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,355
The house owner lives in the city and comes once in a while.

497
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:36,825
If we get caught, then it's over.

498
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:40,005
I need to pack immediately.

499
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:47,765
So that's why we have to sneak in and out.

500
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:49,675
Then, why are we here?

501
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,925
I'm going to pack a few things.

502
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:05,035
We didn't know when we would get kicked out, so we each packed a bag.

503
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,825
Give me one. I'll hold it.

504
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,335
Thanks.

505
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:23,655
Lapis lazuli. It's the real deal.

506
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:27,165
I heard it used to be quite rare and expensive back then.

507
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:34,615
I didn't know I would see the lapis lazuli that I was supposed to see at Go Yoo Han's house here.

508
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,075
Lapis lazuli is slang for Mono's medicine.

509
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:49,395
A medicine that lets a Mono see colors even without a Probe.

510
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:53,765
But my sister, who couldn't buy one because it was too expensive,

511
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:56,155
received one suddenly

512
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:01,145
from a handsome oppa with a black mask on.

513
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,335
It was Go Yoo Han.

514
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:08,815
My sister, who was expecting a blue pill wrapped in a white paper,

515
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:12,635
was given a stone by an oppa wearing a mask.

516
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:17,255
To my sister, it was a useless stone.

517
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:26,405
I saw the disappointment on her face when she came home and told me the story.

518
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:30,605
It was so funny.

519
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:41,765
What's funnier is that the oppa wearing the mask

520
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:46,375
told her to keep it safe until he returned.

521
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:50,685
Why did those people kidnap Go Yoo Han and not me?

522
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:55,265
Lapis lazuli is chunggeumsuk.
(T/N: Chunggeumsuk is lapis lazuli in Korean.)

523
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,035
It's not medicine, but a mineral.

524
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:04,435
Of course, you can extract medicinal ingredients from the mineral, but

525
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:07,625
it doesn't have much relevance to a medicine's name.

526
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:13,845
But do you know the reason behind it?

527
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:16,125
Why?

528
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:21,475
Because it was so rare and precious,

529
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:25,625
only the most important person can acquire it.

530
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:34,375
Timing and Subtitles by the Somewhere over the Rainbow 🌈 Team @ Viki

531
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:40,755
At that time, my sister told me the only ones who were disappointed that lapis lazuli was a stone

532
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:46,565
were Gray Scale, and that oppa was tailing them.

533
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:55,665
A stone that only the most important person can acquire because it's so rare and precious.

534
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:04,135
You can have that stone.

535
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:08,515
- Really?
- The owner of that lapis lazuli is you.

536
00:43:08,515 --> 00:43:11,155
My sister was only keeping it safe for a bit.

537
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:16,755
But don't forget my sister.

538
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:22,825
She put a lot of care into raising that stone, wiping it until it shined so bright every day.

539
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:28,915
Of course. I'm thankful to your sister and I'll cherish it.

540
00:43:30,615 --> 00:43:32,245
Let's go.

541
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,445
But raise a stone?

542
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:40,835
Yes. There are a lot of people who raise stones.

543
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:44,575
They don't speak, don't go anywhere,

544
00:43:44,575 --> 00:43:48,165
and are always there.

545
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,105
Okay. I'll try to raise this stone well.

546
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:56,325
In return,

547
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,145
let me stay at your place for a few days.

548
00:44:02,145 --> 00:44:07,359
This was Se Hyun's true purpose. A favor from my homeless friend.

549
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,575
I know you're happy about it.

550
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,329
What do I say to my aunt?

551
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:18,959
She'll probably say, "It was Go Yoo Han last time, and this time, it's another guy?"

552
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:22,750
She probably won't believe me, no matter how many times I explain it to her.

553
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,900
What are you doing? Don't you have the keys?

554
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,160
Just ring the bell. You said your aunt was home.

555
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,540
I have my key.

556
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,280
Let's go inside.

557
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,170
Aunt, I'm home.

558
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,310
Are you asleep?

559
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,860
Hello. Kim Se Hyun, Yeon Woo's friend, is also here.

560
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,290
I'm in big trouble!

561
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,880
I'm becoming one with the sofa.

562
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,430
[I'm going on a work trip to the countryside. Make sure to eat well, and don't go on the internet!]

563
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,530
[Choi Yeon Woo]

564
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,510
Yeah.

565
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,520
- Where are you?
- Home.

566
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,280
Are you okay?

567
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,440
- Yes.
- That's good to hear.

568
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,240
I'll probably be here for a couple of days, so if you get bored, have a friend over and hang out.

569
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,050
It's better than being in a dark room and watching the mantis being eaten.

570
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,520
If it's an emergency, call me right away, regardless of the time.

571
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,650
Okay.

572
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,740
"If you get bored, have a friend over and hang out."

573
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,860
I heard that clearly.

574
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,790
Anyway, let's wash up.

575
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,400
Okay.

576
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,250
O-Okay. You wash up first.

577
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,250
What are you saying? We can wash up together.

578
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,280
No, thanks. You wash up first.

579
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,350
I'll prepare some food.

580
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,860
Food?

581
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,190
Wow. Thanks!

582
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,950
Hey, hey, hey! It's not there. Go over there.

583
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,090
- Oh, there?
- Yeah.

584
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,700
There's so much stuff here.

585
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,430
Which one's the shampoo and which one's the soap?

586
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,650
Wow! This one smells like honey!

587
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,100
Hey! Can I eat this?

588
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,120
Hey! That's shampoo! If you eat it, you'll─

589
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,810
I only went to a funeral once,

590
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,360
but came back home with trouble.

591
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,380
What are you doing?

592
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,790
Looking to see if there's anyone suspicious.

593
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,770
Do you really have to do that?

594
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,100
It seems like there aren't any.

595
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,730
Now, we can go to sleep reassured.

596
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,590
What are you doing? Let's go sleep.

597
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,960
Yeah, I'm going to...

598
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,920
You can sleep in my room. I'll sleep in the living room.

599
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,380
We can't do that.

600
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,380
If you sleep in the living room, I'll also sleep in the living room.

601
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,080
If you sleep in the room, I'll also sleep in the room.

602
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,420
Why so?

603
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,220
From now on, I will not be more than ten centimeters apart from you.

604
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,930
- Why?
- If I stay further than that,

605
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,730
I can't protect you.

606
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,260
10 centimeters, my foot!

607
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,980
Your aunt's not here. Also, if you were here alone, you would've already been kidnapped.

608
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,800
Don't say such words without evidence.

609
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,800
I don't need evidence.

610
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,020
If I'm apart from you even for a brief moment,

611
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,930
they might come and hurt you anytime.

612
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,310
Is that so?

613
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,080
But sleeping together is troublesome.

614
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,960
So, where will you sleep?

615
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,200
Hurry and choose your location.

616
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,900
Is it your room or the living room?

617
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,420
Your room it is.

618
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,350
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

619
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,630
About what?

620
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,080
Your clothes.

621
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,090
You're treating your guest properly.

622
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,780
Oh, right. Hey, does this neighborhood have a laundromat?

623
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,950
I need to wash all the clothes in that bag.

624
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,290
There is. My aunt is a VIP at that laundromat.

625
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,010
Oh, it smells good. It smells like sunshine.

626
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,630
Se Hyun smiled so brightly when he threw the gym clothes at me.

627
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,340
I didn't know I would be with Se Hyun like this.

628
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,130
My aunt told me it's improper to let the guest sleep on the floor.

629
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,710
I prefer the floor. I can't sleep on the bed because it's uncomfortable.

630
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,440
If you say so...

631
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,930
Are you okay?

632
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,440
Of course, I'm not. I lost my sister.

633
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:11,930
That is why I...

634
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,390
won't ever lose you.

What is it?

799
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,430
Lapis lazuli tea. It's the most popular drink here.

800
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,940
It doesn't have poison or alcohol in it.

801
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:26,290
I heard this was very expensive and that it was a blue pill.

802
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:31,390
The pill is expensive, and this just gets you in the mood.

803
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:34,370
For Level One's, I'll give the first drink for free.

Ah... I was a bit thirsty.

It's vantablack.

What is that?

812
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,660
It's a color you can't distinguish from darkness because it's such a dark black.

813
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:43,920
It's a marvelous color only Monos can see.
-Vantablack.

814
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,590
Vantablack is a substance that was created in England.

815
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:52,430
It's so dark you can't see the texture nor the depth of the color.

816
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:58,440
Your eyes and brain can't process the color because it's so dark.

817
01:09:58,442 --> 01:10:02,632
How can Se Hyun see vantablack?

818

You're... a Mono?

819
01:10:18,775 --> 01:10:22,665
What a turn of events. Se Hyun is also a Mono.

820
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,915
So he was in the darkness without a Probe,

821
01:10:24,915 --> 01:10:27,555
hiding the scary thirst for one

822
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:29,765
and endured it all alone?

823
01:10:29,765 --> 01:10:34,175
Seeing your sister fall into that temptation, you know how scary it is

824
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:38,505
and yet... you endured it all on your own?

This candy is Mono Nerve Chromat. Also known as Nerve Candy.

831
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,409
It's a medicine that makes you experience vantablack more intensely.

832
01:11:26,409 --> 01:11:31,509
You can fall into a never-ending blackness if you eat this with the lazuli tea.

833
01:11:31,509 --> 01:11:34,239
It's cheap and super addicting.

834
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,069
You'll slowly need more candy.

835

It is an illegal drug and has been advertised to help see color when consumed.

01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,600
Bean sprout soup was free!

953
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,560
Let's hurry and eat!

954
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,720
Thanks to the broadcast, it's not just a missing person case.

955
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,960
An investigation has opened, so there should be progress.

956
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,990
Tips are coming in, but nothing special so far.

957
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:14,080
Your mom... was trying to buy the drugs, right?

958
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,480
Yes.

959
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,710
Let's catch them.

960
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:27,460
Those bastards... let's catch them no matter what.

961
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:35,900
I couldn't tell Se Hyun, who said this to me, what my aunt told me.

962
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,140
"Don't cause trouble, since the police are investigating."

963
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,660
Why are you out here?

964
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,260
Aren't you cold?

965
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,820
Don't look.

966
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,780
Why are you acting like this?

01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:26,130
I'll clean this up. You go inside.

970
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,810
No. Let's clean this up before my aunt wakes up.

[Die, Die / Die, Yoo Yi Rang!]

972
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:44,540
Shouldn't we call the police?

973
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:48,400
It's okay. This isn't the first time, anyway.

974
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,100
If they really were going to harm us, they would've broken the window, and made a ruckus.

975
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,680
Oh. This is...

976
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,600
What?

977
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,450
This is the flyer I saw at Maskun Café.

01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,560
I brought a couple of them from Maskun Café.

980
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,520
Isn't Nerve Candy the cheap hallucinogen?

981
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,760
This Nerve Candy... Don't you think this may be Maskun's hideout?

982
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,510
Let's go.

983
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,340
What's wrong?

984
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,960
Don't you want to know the truth?

985
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,470
Let's go after letting my aunt know.

986
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,750
Do you really think she'll let us go if she knows? Let's just go.

987
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,680

I'm sorry, Aunt.

I can't give up like this.

If anything happens, I'll call you and Officer Jung immediately.
- What trouble is he getting into now?

01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,720

We... came after seeing this.

1003
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:19,617
Are you still recruiting members?

1004
01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:31,987
I have this feeling...

1005
01:24:31,987 --> 01:24:34,517
This feeling that this won't be easy.

1006

01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:53,507
Everyone, today is the day of the Lazulata event.

1009
01:24:54,397 --> 01:24:56,837
Luck is on your side.

1010
01:24:56,837 --> 01:24:58,507
Let's go inside.

1011
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:19,507
Did you see how the people's eyes changed?

1012
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:20,907
Yeah.

1013
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:24,947
Isn't Lazulata the beverage we drank at Maskun Café?

1014
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:26,487
No.

1015
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:30,637
That was Lapis Lazuli tea.

1016
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:39,687
Everyone! I'm in a good mood today.

1017
01:25:40,287 --> 01:25:42,097
It's because the best employee was selected this quarter,

1018
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:46,177
and we can open the Lazulata event for you all!

1019
01:25:46,777 --> 01:25:50,847
Employee Moon Soo Yeon? Could you stand up for a bit?

1020
01:25:56,217 --> 01:26:00,127
She is the fourth quarter's best employee, Ms. Moon Soo Yoon. A round of applause, everyone!

1021
01:26:06,577 --> 01:26:08,607
Thank you, Master.

1022
01:26:08,607 --> 01:26:11,237
Thank you for appreciating my small efforts.

1023
01:26:11,237 --> 01:26:13,137
Oh. It's nothing.

1024
01:26:13,137 --> 01:26:18,487
I believe this result was possible because of Ms. Moon Soo Yoon's courage and determination.

1028
01:26:28,537 --> 01:26:30,727
That's right.

1029
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:33,627
That's not the lazuli tea that helps you see vantablack,

1030
01:26:33,627 --> 01:26:38,107
but the Lapis Lazuli, which lets you experience real colors.

1031
01:26:38,107 --> 01:26:40,017
Also known as...

1032

Lazulata.

1033
01:26:42,857 --> 01:26:45,367
Lapis Lazuli really does exist!

1034
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,427
I heard this is very expensive.

1035
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:49,617
This is something you can't buy with money!

1036
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:51,987
- I know, right?
- This is real!

1037
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:55,147
I didn't know they would really give it to us!

1038
01:26:58,517 --> 01:27:01,297
Everyone... Quiet!

1039
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,837
Ms. Moon Soo Yoon, you may take your seat.

1041
01:27:12,657 --> 01:27:16,797
Kim Ye Won, here, was selected as the best employee for the first half.

1042
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:22,047
Yes, she received her Probe surgery!

1043
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:27,497
She is now living a new life as a color artist in Canada.

1044
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:34,877
Everybody,

1045
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:37,397
work hard.

1046
01:27:37,957 --> 01:27:41,347
And become the best employee. Then the Probe surgery...

1047
01:27:41,347 --> 01:27:43,727
is a privilege given to you.

1048

Then, off we go to the colorverse world.

1049
01:27:46,747 --> 01:27:48,387
Enjoy.

1050
01:28:24,027 --> 01:28:30,447
Uh... What... What is this?

1051
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,787
It's a color rush!

1052
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,847
Colors!

1053
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:42,827
Goodness! The world is full of color!

1054
01:29:10,497 --> 01:29:12,527
De-coloring?

1055
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:14,307
No! No!

I'm sorry to say this, but that is the validity of the Lazulata.

1058
01:29:54,372 --> 01:29:57,792
Everyone, work hard!

1059
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,002
And earn a lot of money!

1060
01:30:00,002 --> 01:30:03,482
And get... the Probe surgery.

1061
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,592
Then you will eternally be in the world of colors.

1062
01:30:09,222 --> 01:30:13,912
Thank you.

1063
01:30:22,432 --> 01:30:24,602
Have you come to your senses?

1064
01:30:47,582 --> 01:30:51,242
Where are we?

1065
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,072
This is our dormitory.

1066
01:30:54,302 --> 01:30:56,472
Are you okay?

1067
01:30:57,872 --> 01:31:04,802
Yeah. I never imagined I would see my sister like that.

1068
01:31:05,772 --> 01:31:10,202
It was so fascinating that I couldn't stop looking.

1069
01:31:11,612 --> 01:31:16,842
My sister in color looked fascinating and unfamiliar.

1070
01:31:20,552 --> 01:31:25,092
But how can there be no blankets or pillows here?

1071
01:31:26,052 --> 01:31:30,192
Don't you think today was a series of surprises?

1072
01:31:30,192 --> 01:31:34,972
Yeah. It was an "additional but optional" experience for me.

1073
01:31:34,992 --> 01:31:37,292
- This was your first color rush, right?
- Yeah.

1074
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:40,212
- De-coloring, too?
- Obviously.

1075
01:31:40,212 --> 01:31:46,372
It's hard to be just fine after experiencing both of them. You're amazing.

1076
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:50,182
How cute.

1077

Let's hurry and sleep.

1078
01:31:54,962 --> 01:31:58,202
We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

1079

Just look at me for a short time. You're going to wear out my face.

1095
01:33:18,882 --> 01:33:22,232
Okay. Just for a short while.

1096
01:33:25,402 --> 01:33:29,342
Then, can I look at you for a little longer?

1097
01:33:31,182 --> 01:33:32,792
Yes.

1098

01:33:54,525 --> 01:34:00,875
did you endure that pain... without showing any of it?

1103
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:05,219
In the past, I just endured it.

1104
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:10,779
But at some point, I saw you standing in that darkness.

1105
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:14,279
And you shined a light.

1106
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:19,429
A warm and comfortable light that shined softly.

1107

Since then, I wanted to protect you.

What? They even mixed in red pepper paste.

1111
01:34:52,725 --> 01:34:57,575
Wow, it's so delicious. Hurry up and try.

1112
01:35:00,765 --> 01:35:03,725
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1113
01:35:03,785 --> 01:35:06,495
Yeah, I'm okay.

1114
01:35:07,255 --> 01:35:09,985
It's a side effect you can experience after de-coloring.

1115
01:35:09,985 --> 01:35:12,365
I'm going to get some fresh air.

1116
01:35:14,085 --> 01:35:15,865
Let's go together.

1117
01:35:15,865 --> 01:35:22,065
If you do, I'm going to be mad. Hurry up and eat. You can't catch a cold.

1118
01:35:22,065 --> 01:35:23,950
Come back soon.

1119
01:35:51,215 --> 01:35:52,995
Hi.

1120
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:56,855
Hello.

1121
01:36:00,045 --> 01:36:02,475
Does your head hurt?

1122
01:36:02,475 --> 01:36:05,895
Yes, but I don't know why.

1123
01:36:11,095 --> 01:36:15,615
Monos who had a Probe experience headaches as a side effect of an

1124
01:36:15,615 --> 01:36:19,955
artificial color rush because they experienced the real one before.

1125
01:36:19,955 --> 01:36:22,025
I see.

1126
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:27,035
I had a Probe, too.

1127
01:36:31,355 --> 01:36:34,515
Ever since I came here,

1128
01:36:35,315 --> 01:36:39,385
I keep wondering every day if that person

1129
01:36:39,385 --> 01:36:41,595
is alive or dead.

1130
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:47,895
That person took medicine daily because of their severe depression.

1131
01:36:49,495 --> 01:36:51,955
It wasn't normal.

1132
01:36:53,555 --> 01:36:56,635
That person could die at any moment.

1133
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:02,495
Surely, they didn't die, right?

1134
01:37:06,155 --> 01:37:07,985
Yes.

1135
01:37:08,825 --> 01:37:13,065
If your Probe dies, your heart hurts like it's being torn apart.

1136
01:37:13,965 --> 01:37:17,845
That's how the Mono and Probe are connected.

1137
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:23,365
Do you feel that way now, Soo Yeon?

1138
01:37:27,995 --> 01:37:31,595
No. I think I'm okay.

1139
01:37:33,575 --> 01:37:35,465
Then rest assured.

1140
01:37:35,465 --> 01:37:39,925
Your Probe is definitely not dead.

1141
01:37:46,555 --> 01:37:51,745
But the fact is, they left me.

1142
01:37:52,895 --> 01:37:58,125
They told me I was being too obsessive... and to please get lost.

1143
01:38:00,265 --> 01:38:05,355
That's why I came here. To get the Probe surgery.

1144
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,385
Probe surgery?

1145
01:38:09,295 --> 01:38:12,925
Then I won't obsess over that person anymore.

1146
01:38:13,835 --> 01:38:17,125
Then I won't have the urge to kill them.

1147
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:20,465
- But still, Probe surgery─
- I will get it.

1148
01:38:22,065 --> 01:38:25,005
You don't know the sadness of losing your Probe.

1149
01:38:44,245 --> 01:38:47,365
Is it true...

1150
01:38:47,365 --> 01:38:51,635
that your heart feels like it's being torn apart when you're separated from your Probe?

1151
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:55,775
No. It just came to my mind right now.

1152
01:38:57,665 --> 01:38:59,735
I was taken aback for no reason.

1153
01:39:00,605 --> 01:39:02,355
But...

1154
01:39:02,945 --> 01:39:06,475
I did wonder if it really felt like that.

1155
01:39:07,135 --> 01:39:12,025
I had a feeling that Go Yoo Han was close to me.

1156
01:39:13,655 --> 01:39:16,195
But let's say Go Yoo Han died...

1157
01:39:16,955 --> 01:39:19,405
I, too,

1158
01:39:19,405 --> 01:39:22,605
don't think it will just end with my heart being torn apart.

1159
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:27,495
Then... it's true.

1160
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:32,805
I mean, wouldn't it─

1161
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:35,495
Why are you making it so complicated?

1162
01:39:35,495 --> 01:39:38,235
It's just true.

1163
01:39:47,275 --> 01:39:49,435
I feel like that, too.

1164
01:39:49,435 --> 01:39:52,425
I feel like you and I are connected, too.

1165
01:39:53,135 --> 01:39:57,795
If something happens to you, I won't be able to endure it.

1166
01:39:57,795 --> 01:40:00,935
It would be better if something happened to me instead.

1167
01:40:16,235 --> 01:40:19,865
1428. Work harder.

1168
01:40:28,595 --> 01:40:32,635
[Yesterday's best worker, Choi Woo Seok, made 4600 Nerve Candy]

1169
01:40:53,395 --> 01:40:57,025
What does that mean?

1170
01:40:57,025 --> 01:41:02,095
It means she tried to scold you, but she gave you a chance because you're handsome.

1171
01:41:02,095 --> 01:41:05,505
Wow. How much are─

1172
01:41:06,035 --> 01:41:07,465
we─

1173
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:12,405
Hey, hurry it up. Are you crafting something?

1174
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:13,815
Seriously.

1175
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:15,735
Hold on a bit.

1176
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:22,765
Isn't everything supposed to be a scam? The report also said it was.

1177
01:41:23,895 --> 01:41:26,495
That's right...

1178
01:41:27,305 --> 01:41:32,005
But the Lapis lazuli tea, the Nerve Candy,

1179
01:41:32,005 --> 01:41:34,575
and even the Lazulata exist.

1180
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:39,785
That's right.

1181
01:41:39,785 --> 01:41:42,665
Then, what exactly did we see?

1182
01:41:44,195 --> 01:41:45,435
Optical illusion?

1183
01:41:45,435 --> 01:41:48,935
No. It was definitely a color rush,

1184
01:41:48,935 --> 01:41:52,035
since we experienced de-coloring, too.

1185
01:41:54,325 --> 01:41:58,595
My aunt was wrong. Lapis lazuli is real.

1186
01:42:00,225 --> 01:42:02,295
There's one thing I'm sure of.

1187
01:42:02,295 --> 01:42:04,805
What is that?

1188
01:42:04,805 --> 01:42:07,825
Let's say we were tricked by something else for everything.

1189
01:42:07,825 --> 01:42:11,365
But you can't fake the Probe surgery.

1190
01:42:11,365 --> 01:42:14,105
You either become a Mono that can actually see colors...

1191
01:42:14,105 --> 01:42:18,035
or you die. It's one or the other.

1192
01:42:18,035 --> 01:42:23,835
Also, they are... definitely lying about your younger sister.

1193
01:42:24,995 --> 01:42:30,765
Moon Soo Yeon, the best employee for the fourth quarter, will be getting the Probe surgery tonight.

1194
01:42:30,765 --> 01:42:37,005
Please give her a round of applause as a show of encouragement that the surgery will be successful. Give her a hand.

1195
01:42:44,995 --> 01:42:46,835
Where could it be?

1196
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:48,835
Operating room?

1197
01:42:48,835 --> 01:42:52,835
There was no operating room here. Only an infirmary.

1198
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:56,095
Then...

1199
01:42:56,095 --> 01:43:01,505
Earlier, I saw a sign that said "Dr. Gupta Lab."

1200
01:43:01,505 --> 01:43:03,985
That place seems suspicious.

1201
01:43:05,835 --> 01:43:09,945
That's the place. They do Probe surgery there.

1202
01:43:11,735 --> 01:43:15,445
Let's go. We'll know when we get there.

1203
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:21,035
Let's go together.

1204
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:24,515
[Dr. Gupta Lab]

1205
01:43:56,095 --> 01:43:57,335
[nuv candy company]

1206
01:44:06,605 --> 01:44:09,865
I really need to succeed in this surgery.

1207
01:44:09,865 --> 01:44:13,135
Yes. I'll raise it to 350 watts this time.

1208
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,960
Upping this.

1209
01:44:30,575 --> 01:44:32,595
Do you think it'll work?

1210
01:44:33,165 --> 01:44:34,995
Leave.

1211
01:44:35,645 --> 01:44:38,975
I need to witness the surgery with my own eyes.

1212
01:44:44,475 --> 01:44:47,715
Do you really believe this will work?

1213
01:44:47,715 --> 01:44:52,435
She's the 37th person. That quack, Dr. Gupta, is just killing people!

1214
01:44:54,195 --> 01:44:56,090
It will definitely work.

1215
01:44:56,090 --> 01:45:00,140
And when it does, it's only a matter of time before we'll be sitting on a pile of money. You know that, don't you?

1216
01:45:00,145 --> 01:45:03,345
Honey, please wake up!

1217
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:07,035
The money we spent on this is already a billion won (a million dollars)!

1218
01:45:08,265 --> 01:45:11,715
Whether it's one billion or ten billion, please just succeed, Dr. Gupta!

1219
01:45:11,715 --> 01:45:15,095
Show us the skill that we saw in India!

1220
01:45:15,095 --> 01:45:16,745
Here you go again.

1221
01:45:16,745 --> 01:45:21,215
I told you who knows how many times that Gupta scammed us then, but you still won't believe me.

1222
01:45:21,745 --> 01:45:25,925
A conman is being conned by another conman. Why can't you see that?

1223
01:45:25,925 --> 01:45:28,535
- That's not a surgery.
- This is so frustrating, I'm going mad.

1224
01:45:28,535 --> 01:45:31,405
It's merely an experiment meant to fail.

1225
01:45:31,405 --> 01:45:33,915
To stimulate the brain with those electrical probes.

1226
01:45:33,915 --> 01:45:37,145
They're basically murdering them.

1227
01:45:39,415 --> 01:45:41,205
Let's stop them.

1228
01:45:42,825 --> 01:45:47,075
Students! You are seeing something you shouldn't be seeing.

1229
01:45:57,995 --> 01:45:59,545
Stop them.

1230
01:47:09,255 --> 01:47:10,895
This punk!

1231
01:47:42,755 --> 01:47:44,645
Are you okay?

1232
01:47:50,105 --> 01:47:52,605
Watch out!

1233
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,750
Se Hyun...

1234
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,350
Se Hyun, wake up!

1235
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,230
Yeon Woo...

1236
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:06,590
I know...

1237
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:10,830
you only have Go Yoo Han

1238
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:12,500
in your heart.

1239
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,100
You'll eventually...

1240
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:20,430
leave me, right?

1241
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:30,470
I... will only remember that I liked you...

1242
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:37,760
and the fact... that I protected you.

1243
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,700
I don't ever want to...

1244
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,220
remember that you left me.

1245
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:52,750
Don't say such things. We need to escape this place!

1246
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:55,760
We have to make it out alive!

1247
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,960
Open your eyes, huh?

1248
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,450
Min Jae,

1249
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,590
where is Go Yoo Han?

1250
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:27,810
Near you. But it may also not be Go Yoo Han.

1251
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:32,450
What do you mean?

1252
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,360
Aunt.

1253
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:03,000
It's a relief you're alive.

1254
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,280
I'll deal with you when you're better and done with the treatments.

1255
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,780
I'm sorry.

1256
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:14,800
Get well soon. Your friend keeps asking for only you.

1257
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:20,380
Yeon Woo, are you okay?

1258
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:31,860
He broke like every part of his body, but he's still acting like that.

1259
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:36,020
Why are there so many guys in this world that care for you?

1260
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:40,590
My goodnes, you guys are making a fuss.

1261
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:43,520
- Ow!
- So. Who. Told. You. To. Do. Such. Dangerous. Things.

1262
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,180
That hurts, Aunt!

1263
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,020
- Do you think this is enough to let you get away with it?
- Aunt! Aunt!

1264
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:51,550
It's my fault. Please don't hit him.

1265
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:54,210
I got it, Kim Se Hyun.

1266
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,900
Stay still, so your bones can stick together.

1267
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,800
Okay.

1268
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:07,790
We found out that Grayscale and Maskun are one after searching Nuv Candy.

1269
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:11,110
The police arrested all the managers there.

1270
01:51:11,110 --> 01:51:12,700
What about Lee Sang Jae?

1271
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:17,350
In my opinion, Lee Sang Jae is the mastermind, and Monowife is his accomplice.

1272
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:19,310
We lost both of them.

1273
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:23,070
But it's only a matter of time until they'll be arrested, since they're on the wanted list.

1274
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:29,310
I'm going on an urgent business trip.

1275
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:34,030
It's a place Lee Sang Jae used to run. I don't know what we'll find there, but it's going to be broadcast live.

1276
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:36,740
Let me know if you know anything as you watch,

1277
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,650
since you've already been to Nuv Candy.

1278
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,790
Okay. I know a lot.

1279
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:44,190
Is that something to be proud of? You shouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm leaving.
- I understand.

1280
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:45,730
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1281
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:47,560
Ouch.

1282
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,640
Se Hyun, are you really okay?

1283
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:59,640
Yeah. Don't worry. I'm a man of steel.

1284
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:02,520
Hey, stay still.

1285
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:05,160
You'll hurt yourself.

1286
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,590
Even though Se Hyun was all bandaged up,

1287
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:12,260
I found Se Hyun, who was worried about me, cute.

1288
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:24,260
My friends. Thank you for visiting me at the hospital.

1289
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:31,620
Back then, you both were responsible for the forced broadcast, right?

1290
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:33,960
How did you know?

1291
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,400
You two are the only ones among my friends with those skills.

1292
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:41,470
Hi, guys!

1293
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:50,510
What the heck! A mummy?

1294
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:53,740
Can I get some juice, too?

1295
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:55,630
Se Hyun?

1296
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,430
A mummy is talking.

1297
01:53:00,430 --> 01:53:03,070
It's because it's a Korean mummy.

1298
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:06,930
Egyptian mummies talk well, too. Anck Su Namun.

1299
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:14,090
Give me some juice.

1300
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:29,030
Nobody searches this reservoir because there is no owner.

1301
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:34,030
Recently, many remains have been found here, due to floods caused by heavy rain.

1302
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:36,140
One moment, please.

1303
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,990
Are you a villager? One moment, please.

1304
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:40,230
- I don't know anything.
- Wait a moment.

1305
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:42,960
Do you know anything about this reservoir?

1306
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:47,820
I really don't know. All the villagers

1307
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:49,480
don't know, either.

1308
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,770
What about─

1309
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,440
I really don't know. All the villagers

1310
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,850
Oh.

1311
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:12,470
What's up, Yeon Woo?

1312
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:18,000
That voice right now! In the interview! That's Lee Sang Jae. It was Lee Sang Jae's voice!

1313
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,760
Hey, Lee Sang Jae!

1314
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:26,620
Stop right there!

1315
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:32,610
- Stay still.
- Let go!

1316
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:34,780
- Let go!
- Stay still!

1317
01:54:35,884 --> 01:54:38,692
You are under arrest for murder and fraud.

1318
01:54:38,692 --> 01:54:42,422
You have the right to remain silent.

1319
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:45,950
Hey!

1320
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:09,805
This is the reservoir Lee Sang Jae frequently visited.

1321
01:55:09,805 --> 01:55:14,225
Lee Sang Jae pretended to be a villager here and occasionally fished─

1322
01:55:20,945 --> 01:55:23,185
She wore a hairband?

1323
01:55:23,185 --> 01:55:26,405
Yeah. A yellow hairband.

1324
01:55:26,405 --> 01:55:29,875
Did she? I have no memory of it.

1325
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:32,545
You bought it for her.

1326
01:55:32,545 --> 01:55:34,225
I did?

1327
01:55:46,235 --> 01:55:47,765
What's wrong?

1328
01:55:48,365 --> 01:55:52,205
Sis. Sis!

1329
01:55:52,205 --> 01:55:54,615
Sis!

1330
01:56:00,905 --> 01:56:02,905
Sis.

1331
01:56:07,995 --> 01:56:09,775
Sis.

1332
01:56:11,615 --> 01:56:16,755
When speculation of what if this happens becomes reality,

1333
01:56:16,755 --> 01:56:20,245
surprisingly, I become calm.

1334
01:56:21,285 --> 01:56:23,695
Rather than being shocked from my mother's death,

1335
01:56:23,695 --> 01:56:27,645
I found comfort in that she's

1336
01:56:27,645 --> 01:56:30,035
now resting in a warm place.

1337
01:56:46,805 --> 01:56:48,695
I'm going...

1338
01:56:50,155 --> 01:56:52,325
to leave this place now.

1339
01:56:53,775 --> 01:56:55,845
I'm going to leave...

1340
01:56:57,395 --> 01:57:00,195
and your Probe will appear.

1341
01:57:04,885 --> 01:57:06,975
You're a Mono...

1342
01:57:08,415 --> 01:57:10,345
and so am I.

1343
01:57:13,355 --> 01:57:16,205
This is our end.

1344
01:57:16,205 --> 01:57:17,745
And...

1345
01:57:19,225 --> 01:57:21,705
this is my first...

1346
01:57:23,025 --> 01:57:24,695
and last...

1347
01:57:25,885 --> 01:57:27,865
gift to you.

1348
01:57:30,325 --> 01:57:31,905
What?

1349
01:57:47,425 --> 01:57:50,625
Don't forgive me, who's leaving you.

1350
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:52,275
But...

1351
01:57:53,505 --> 01:57:56,315
please remember just this moment.

1352
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:05,235
I will never forget you.

1353
01:58:07,025 --> 01:58:12,625
Because... I like you.

1354
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:20,580
♫  I'm very different than how I was before ♫

1355
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:26,690
♫  I'm scared of this unfamiliar me ♫

1356
01:58:28,475 --> 01:58:30,145
What are you doing?

1357
01:58:32,975 --> 01:58:36,315
Oh, uh...

1358
01:58:37,295 --> 01:58:40,085
I was just...

1359
01:58:40,685 --> 01:58:43,865
Let's go back. I'll buy you ramen with rice cake.

1360
01:58:43,865 --> 01:58:49,125
Shouldn't you at least buy me jjampong when I've done so much for you?
(T/N: Jjampong is a spicy noodle dish made from either seafood or pork-based broth)

1361
01:58:49,125 --> 01:58:50,805
Jjampong?

1362
01:58:51,715 --> 01:58:53,855
Deal.

1363
01:58:53,855 --> 01:58:56,195
With fried dumplings?

1364
01:58:56,195 --> 01:58:58,315
Dumplings are usually on the house, so...

1365
01:58:58,315 --> 01:58:59,915
Okay, deal!

1366
01:58:59,915 --> 01:59:02,035
Okay. Let's go.

1367
01:59:03,285 --> 01:59:06,655
- Hey. Are we never getting tangsuyuk?
- What?
(T/N: Tangsuyuk is a meat dish with sweet and sour sauce.)

1368
01:59:08,235 --> 01:59:09,735
Let's go.

1369
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:15,220
♫  Adore you   ♫

1370
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:20,110
♫  Even if I tried to hide it, it's noticeable ♫

1371
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:25,120
♫  Adore you ♫

1372
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:30,280
♫  I'm drawing a full painting of you ♫

1373
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:37,265
♫  My feelings are shining brightly ♫
