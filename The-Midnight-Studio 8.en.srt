Okay. By the way, have a look at this.

325
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,900
Doesn't it look like he's trying to push her instead of saving her?

326
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,550
Looks like he's just holding her.

327
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,430
Really? Look closer.

328
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,040
Oh? Isn't that the attorney? Attorney Han?

329
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,490
What was Attorney Han doing here...

330
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,820
Seo Ki... Hey, this is Seo Ki Joo, right?

331
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,420
You're right.

332
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,560
Hold on. He came to the crime scene, too.

333
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,910
He was probably just seeking attention.

334
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,530
Like those people who like to play detectives.

335
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,150
We did a background check on him, right? Bring that to me.

00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,170
- Okay, I'll get it for you right away.
- Okay.

337

- We should get some soju.
- Shall we?

342
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,290
I made a plan with a friend.

It will take you forever at that rate.

Haven't you ever sent a package before?

347

Deputy Park, I thought you left.

348

Can't believe how slow you are.

349

Let's finish it quickly before I change my mind.

Thank you, Deputy Park.

351

Seriously, they're as shameless as ever.

352
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,920
The tape. Where's the other tape?

353
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,560
It's on my desk.

354
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,370
What's this?

355
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,680
It's a ghost repellent.

356
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,030
A friend gave it to me.

357
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,290
I heard there's an angry ghost at our office who couldn't become a deputy three years ago.

358
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,560
He's afraid he'll lose his desk.

359
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,350
So he kicks out whenever there's someone new.

360
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,410
Oh, I see.

361
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,920
But I guess you didn't hear this.

362
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,570
That you're using his desk right now.

363

Really?

364
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,380
I knew it. I got goosebumps for no reason.

365
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,820
Did you hear why he died, too?

366

From overworking.

369
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,060
He thought he should work hard and get a good job.

370
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,370
After that, he thought

371
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,490
getting promoted,

Without going home or taking weekends off,

he worked every night without taking a trip anywhere

Bom, I'm working late tonight.

Thank you for being my bodyguard today, Mr. Seo.

Are you really sleeping?

Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

438
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,410
It's because of Choi Hoon, isn't it?

439
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,410
Because the gate of the dead is closed,

Ms. Na, why did you kill the counselor who's been helping you? Why did you do that?

487
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,530
Do you have anything to say to the victim's family?

488
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,510
What do you think of the public calling it "A kind young man's tragic death"?

489
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,630
My client is a victim of stalking by a criminal under the guise of a suicide prevention hotline counselor.

490
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,710
Sounds like you're saying a proper investigation

491
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,180
on the stalking could've prevented his death. Is that right?

492
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,050
In a nutshell, this is clearly a stalking case in which my client defended herself

493
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:53,600
from the attacker who threatened her after stalking her for six months

494
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,970
after the police refused to look into it.

495
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,810
Do you mean you blame the prosecution and the police for refusing to investigate?

496
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:04,320
Last year, the police issued arrest warrants to 1.2% of the reported stalkers.

497
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,130
And the Prosecutors' Office issued bench warrants to less than 5% of them.

498
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,440
I think that should answer your questions.

499
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,550
That's all. Let's go.

00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,870
[Lee Hyeon Oh's Minister of Justice confirmation hearing preparation office]
In a nutshell, this is clearly a stalking case in which

649
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,200
my client defended herself from the attacker

650
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,480
who threatened her after stalking her for six months

651
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,140
after the police refused to look into it.

652
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,810
Do you mean you blame the prosecution and the police for refusing to investigate?

653
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,350
Last year, the police-

654
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,880
Looks like it became clear that the late Choi Hoon was the defendant's stalker.

655
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,110
They have clear evidence to prove it, too.

656
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,410
And since it took long to arrest Park Doo Chil, who killed a police officer,

657
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:30,150
the image of the Prosecutors' Office and police was significantly damaged.

658
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,770
Make sure the media doesn't call it a lax investigation.

659
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,250
Got it.

660
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,580
And speaking of a lax investigation,

661
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:42,680
we should also prep you on Kim Yoon Cheol, the 2019 vacation rental murder suspect.

662
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,410
The case was closed. Why?

663
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,840
It's true, but it was a controversial case internally.

664
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:54,020
I'm sure the opposition party will bring that up again in addition to the current case.

Could you go there and put in an order for me?
