As I mentioned earlier, "Single Heaven"

63
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:33,946
emphasizes that both love and dating are illusory

64
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:37,036
and tries to differentiate itself from existing dating programs.

65
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:42,626
I'm certain that viewers no longer believe in the sweetness of love.

66
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:46,766
Because in today's society, love is not an absolute emotion.

67
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,256
It's an unnecessary, uncomfortable,

68

and even unpleasant emotion.

I'm Jeong Ha Ram, a new Planning and Production Team member.

The reason I can't relate to Team Leader Seo Yi Jun's proposal is...

81
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:47,256
The reason is?

82
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,296
Because I believe in love.

Sure, you might not believe in love. However...

What's your basis for thinking that?

89
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:24,686
First of all, it's too emotional. It's not objective. How should I put this?

90
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,656
Like the negative emotions of someone who has been hurt in a relationship?

but I don't think they're familiar with the concept.

They're just being biased

00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,676
Let's both make confessions here and now.

167
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,476
That we are losers in dating.

168
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,576
What are you saying?

169
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,886
I'm not a relationship virgin.

170
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,636
Rest your hand on your heart and tell me honestly.

171
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:02,806
I know you only have flings through dating apps.

172
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:07,726
What's wrong with that?

173
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,486
Sure.

174
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,171
Team Leader Seo,

175
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,071
when was your most recent relationship?

176
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,816
That was...

177
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,976
See? You don't remember, do you?

178
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:24,516
In that regard, let's do it.

179
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,616
No, we must!

180
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:28,146
Do what exactly?

181
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:32,326
Love sensibility training.

182
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:35,306
L-Love training?

183
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:38,542
Take this opportunity to meet someone.

184
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,752
Let's recover our lost sensibilities.

185
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,466
This is the only way to save our proposal.

186
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:51,926
Don't you think the method is too peculiar?

187
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:55,096
Just trust and follow me for now.

188
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:18,558
Team Leader Seo,

189
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,868
when was your most recent relationship?

190
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,888
When was it again?

191
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,198
What is the use of recalling that?

192
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,638
Love sensibility? That's ridiculous.

193
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,578
I like things as they are now.

194
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,928
Team Leader!

195
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,398
Excuse me.

196
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:07,938
Team Leader. Team Leader!

197
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,138
What the heck?

198
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:18,278
Wow. What a coincidence.

199
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,348
I'm so glad to see you.

200
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:22,718
Is it fate and not a coincidence?

201
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:25,238
It's hot. Go somewhere else.

202
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,378
There are so many empty seats.

203
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:31,648
Why? Isn't it cozy between workplace seonbae and hubae?

204
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:37,728
You must not be happy to see me at all.

205
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,248
Do I have a reason to be?

206
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:44,808
Wow. You sure know how to hold grudges.

207
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:47,038
Are you still upset?

208
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,568
Let's go quietly.

209
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,658
Daebak. Sure, sure.

210
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,118
I'll do as you say.

211
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,198
Without permission, once again!

212
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:25,878
What do you call a fish wearing a bowtie?

213
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,848
Sofishticated!

214
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,206
What did the ocean say to the beach?

215
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,556
Nothing, it just waved.

216
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:36,626
[What is "Single Heaven"? Proposal Objective]

217
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:44,268
Team Leader Seo. A drink after work?

218
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,128
I can't.

219
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:52,446
Let's go. Let's go!

220
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,326
Drink? Let's go.

221
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:03,778
My work life was under duress because of that punk.

222
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,808
Team Leader Seo, lighten up!

223
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:13,818
I'll give you a chance to throw a punch at the newbie later.

224
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:15,798
Really?

225
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:17,238
Hey, you're here.

226
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,748
- Okay, Okay.
- Hello. Hello.

227
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:29,190
Writer, can you switch seats with me?

228
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,700
Sure.

229
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,618
I'm sorry, but can you switch seats with me?

230
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,298
Thank you.

231
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,278
Honestly...

232
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:47,168
Gosh.

233
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,713
Come on, that's enough.

234
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:55,683
We're not playing musical chairs. Round and round...

235
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,848
Hey, D&D.

236
00:17:56,848 --> 00:18:02,078
Let's drink and die. Fill your glasses and raise them.

237
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,586
One shot! Let's have fun!

238
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,686
Cheers!

239
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,900
Eat up.

240
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,528
Team Leader.

241
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,538
Do you know what a newbie like me wants the most at work?

242
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,878
I'm not interested. Don't talk to me.

243
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:25,898
What is it? I'm curious.

244
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,598
A seonbae's affection.

245
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:31,658
Generous love for his hubae.

246
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:33,538
Do you want affection?

247
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:37,088
Hey, does someone who longs for affection

248
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:39,458
screw his Team Leader over like that?

249
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,418
Hey, Team Leader Seo is too kind.

250
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:45,718
If it were me, I would have slapped both of your cheeks.

251
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,238
Relationship virgin? Loser?

252
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:52,968
Hey, take this chance to officially apologize to your team leader.

253
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,038
- Wait, Manager.
- Hey, it's okay.

254
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,818
A hubae should show affection first,

255
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:59,648
for his seonbae to adore him.

256
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,768
All right!

257
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,306
I'll officially apologize to you.

258
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:08,458
In return, please grant me one wish.

259
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:12,048
No. J-Just sit down.

260
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,808
Hey, Team Leader Seo.

261
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:17,608
Accept his apology and grant him a wish!

262
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,088
Okay?

263
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:24,108
Team Leader...

264
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:28,318
I won't call you a loser in dating ever again.

265
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:34,128
You're absolutely not a relationship virgin.

266
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:37,848
So please don't hate me too much.

267
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,648
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:46,938
Can I tell you my wish now?

269
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,918
Let's do a love shot.

270
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,828
What?

271
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,768
What the heck?

272
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,758
Love shot.

273
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:06,866
Love shot.

274
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,486
Love shot. Love shot.

275
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,248
It's my wish.

276
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:24,038
Love shot. Love shot.

277
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,138
The two of you...

278
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:36,638
You guys should be our official team couple starting today.

279
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,498
- Happy?
- Hey.

280
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:43,088
One glass is disappointing. I'm overflowing with affection.

281
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:47,026
Show us.

282
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,448
Show us. Show us.

283
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,188
Show us.

284
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:55,648
Show us. Show us.

285
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,968
Fine. Let's do another glass.

286
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:00,218
Sounds good.

287
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:09,768
Let's do it with soju.

288
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,998
Team Leader!

289
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,778
Aigo, are you all right?

290
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:30,928
Go away.

291
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:35,428
- How can I just leave you here?
- Just leave me alone and go.

292
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,918
Gosh.

293
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,518
What do you want from me?

294
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:43,298
Why can't you leave me alone?

295
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,138
Since it's your fault.

296
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,968
My fault?

297
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:54,128
Tell me. What is my fault?

298
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,888
That you're shaking up my heart.

299
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:08,968
What nonsense are you spewing? You're drunk, are you?

300
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:17,538
No. I fell in love with you...

301
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:22,226
at first sight.

302
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:23,636
What?

303
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:35,056
♫ At first, I couldn't help my fluttering heart ♫

304
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:42,146
♫ I can't help but look at you to my heart's content ♫

305
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:43,826
Hey.

306
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:46,676
Even if I seem like a pushover to you,

307
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:49,086
you should know when to stop.

308
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:54,176
I provoked you intentionally. Shock treatment.

309
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:59,086
Since you don't believe in love, Team Leader.

310
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,736
So? You fell for me. So what?

311
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:10,196
I want to...

312
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:15,816
date you.

313
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:17,326
What?

314
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,386
You're definitely drunk and out of your senses.

315
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:28,276
I'm very serious right now.

316
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:31,326
- What is 8 times 9?
- 72. See? I'm fine, right?

317
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,096
Dream on.

318
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,556
Why?

319
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,616
Why should I date you out of all the people?

320
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,276
Do you think you're special?

321
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:42,880
I'm tall.

322
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,556
I'm reliable.

323
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:50,426
And most importantly, I'm handsome.

324
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:54,976
I might look like this, but I'm top-notch when it comes to blind dating.

325
00:23:56,056 --> 00:24:00,136
That's what you think. I don't think so.

326
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:02,336
Which aspect of me?

327
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:04,726
That ridiculous shock therapy

328
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,526
and a confession out of the blue.

329
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:10,496
You probably thought it was the perfect plan.

330
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,346
But right now, you're being rude.

331
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:17,026
I am super offended right now.

332
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:22,546
I'm sorry, but you better give up on your feelings.

333
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,466

I don't like to. Relationships are too bothersome.

Since there aren't expectations or a need for unnecessary emotions.

Explain what just happened.

Do you think I did something to you?

502
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:02,085
I just checked to see if you were breathing or not

503
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,795
since you lied there like a corpse with no sign of getting up.

504
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:10,225
How did the shoot go?

505
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:14,135
The actors came and started shooting.

508

Responsibility for what?

This.

It was a mistake. It didn't mean anything.

511

Even if it was a mistake, it still happened.

Okay, relax.

- Yes, Manager!

I showed your photos to the CEO for fun.

- He loved them.

522

The CEO said we should use them for the cover story of next month's online newsletter.

You bother me and make me uncomfortable.

542

It's all because of you.

You're not allowed within three meters of me from now on.

Wh-With what?

553
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:14,663
I searched online and learned there are people sensitive to light.

554
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:19,533
They could have seizures, and they could even faint in severe cases.

555
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,953
Light sensitivity or something...

556
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,423
I wondered if that was why you fainted yesterday.

557
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:32,123
Whether I have a seizure or faint is my problem.

It's because you raise my blood pressure.

What kind of dating program when there's no romantic sensibility?

That's unnecessary guilt. I'll do the training.

Anyhow, when did you get on?

I didn't see you at the bus stop.

I thought you might yell at me again if you saw me at the stop,

I just wanted to go on a date with you,

666
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:11,138
but you only meet people through apps, so there was only one way.

667

I looked for you all over the place, installing all kinds of apps.

671

I bought it because I didn't want to look shabby.

You think I came here to play around like you?

676
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,468
You probably came here to train your love sensibility.

677

How deep are you trying to dig?

678

What about me do you like?

You said you weren't curious. This is out of nowhere.

685

I just suddenly became curious.

686

Yes.

694

The reason I like you is because...

696

You're quite a handful.

It was a trivial moment, but my heart was fluttering.

It's obvious. I won't.

Rather than being sad, I was just... really embarrassed.

Were my feelings that insignificant? I felt a sense of shame.

It's just a common break-up repertoire.

Maybe I'm unusual, but it was hard to recover from that.

741

That's when I came to the conclusion...

742

to not like anyone...

743

01:29:58,257 --> 01:30:00,787
You must have found the answer, huh?

993
01:30:00,787 --> 01:30:04,537
I'm not sure yet, but I'll do my best.

994
01:30:05,227 --> 01:30:08,687
Let's pick ourselves back up and do our best.

995
01:30:08,687 --> 01:30:11,777
Gosh! I'm honestly a bit envious of you.

996
01:30:11,777 --> 01:30:14,467
Gosh, why be envious?

997
01:30:51,732 --> 01:30:53,707
What's with the tumbler?

998
01:30:53,707 --> 01:30:56,107
What else? It's a couple's item.

999
01:30:56,107 --> 01:30:57,877
Couple's item?

1000
01:30:58,737 --> 01:31:01,347
What's with that reaction? It's disappointing.

1001
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:04,167
We agreed not to be like this at work.

1002
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,467
I'm doing this because we're at work.

1003
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:09,977
- Seriously, you're...
- Why?

1004
01:31:09,977 --> 01:31:12,437
Stop being so reckless.

1005
01:31:12,437 --> 01:31:14,997
I know you like it, but you're just being shy.

1006
01:31:14,997 --> 01:31:18,657
I'll just use this at home.

1007
01:31:18,657 --> 01:31:21,297
I knew you would be like this. So I prepared one more thing.

1008
01:31:21,297 --> 01:31:24,117
What? What is it? Spill it!

1009
01:31:24,117 --> 01:31:26,547
I ordered couple t-shirts too.

1010
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:28,687
What? Couple t-shirt?

1011
01:31:30,287 --> 01:31:31,377
I'm sorry.

1012
01:31:31,377 --> 01:31:34,327
You were so cute just now.

1013
01:31:34,327 --> 01:31:36,327
Cancel it this instant!

1014
01:31:37,057 --> 01:31:39,357
I don't want to.

1015
01:31:39,357 --> 01:31:42,147
Doing this without consulting me is unfair.

1016
01:31:42,147 --> 01:31:45,797
Team Leader Seo, "A couple t-shirt"? What was that? Are you dating someone?

1017
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:49,127
No, I was just working on the proposal.

1018
01:31:49,127 --> 01:31:52,337
You're not buying couple t-shirts with the newbie, are you?

1019
01:31:52,337 --> 01:31:55,397
- Pardon?
- I'm kidding. Look at this.

1020
01:31:55,397 --> 01:31:59,927
The newsletter cover draft is out. Daebak! Look at those eyes.

1021
01:31:59,927 --> 01:32:03,087
Hearts are shooting out. Pop, pop!

1022
01:32:15,487 --> 01:32:18,367
Come to the rooftop garden immediately.

1023
01:32:28,237 --> 01:32:31,087
Why did you react like that if you like it?

1024
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:35,317
We agreed to keep this a secret. You're not cooperating.

1025
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:38,467
I'll let the tumbler slide, so cancel the couple t-shirts.

1026
01:32:38,467 --> 01:32:40,097
They're already being shipped.

1027
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:41,557
What?

1028
01:32:43,817 --> 01:32:45,717
Should I return them?

1029
01:32:46,607 --> 01:32:50,197
You don't even mean that. Oh, right.

1030
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:53,057
Here.

1031
01:32:54,907 --> 01:32:57,287
Hyeong, you came out nice.

1032
01:32:58,867 --> 01:33:00,947
Especially your gaze.

1033
01:33:00,947 --> 01:33:02,697
What about my gaze?

1034
01:33:02,697 --> 01:33:07,227
It's out of the ordinary. It seems like you've fallen for me.

1035
01:33:07,967 --> 01:33:12,067
You're right. To be honest, you shook my heart a bit at the time.

1036
01:33:12,767 --> 01:33:15,097
Is that why you fainted?

1037
01:33:15,097 --> 01:33:16,327
No.

1038
01:33:16,327 --> 01:33:20,127
I fainted while holding my breath because I didn't want to breathe the same air as you.

1039
01:33:20,797 --> 01:33:23,827
I guess I'll just have to believe that.

1040
01:33:23,827 --> 01:33:26,517
Oh, let's take a picture.

1041
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:28,017
What picture?

1042
01:33:28,017 --> 01:33:30,617
To commemorate our first couple item.

1043
01:33:30,617 --> 01:33:32,917
Aren't you tired of taking pictures with me?

1044
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:37,737
As if. Don't be shy and get close to me.

1045
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:39,787
The couple item.

1046
01:33:41,107 --> 01:33:43,337
Lift the photo so it's more visible.

1047
01:33:43,337 --> 01:33:44,657
Like this?

1048
01:33:44,657 --> 01:33:46,557
Yes.

1049
01:33:46,557 --> 01:33:50,147
Make pretty faces. I'm taking it.

1050
01:33:50,147 --> 01:33:53,207
One, two, three!

1051
01:34:14,427 --> 01:34:18,307
What the... What are you two doing here?

1052
01:34:18,307 --> 01:34:21,077
Oh, I was showing him the cover.

1053
01:34:21,077 --> 01:34:24,517
Team Leader Seo, something is going on here, isn't it?

1054
01:34:24,517 --> 01:34:27,917
You two seem to be hanging out a lot recently.

1055
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:31,527
No way. You know we're not on good terms.

1056
01:34:32,697 --> 01:34:35,077
You're really suspicious.

1057
01:34:35,077 --> 01:34:39,287
Exactly. You used to argue all the time.

1058
01:34:47,826 --> 01:34:52,396
Did you know it has already been ten days since we became date mates?

1059
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:54,186
Already?

1060
01:34:54,936 --> 01:34:56,936
Time really flies, doesn't it?

1061
01:34:57,986 --> 01:35:01,186
You're right. Time really flies.

1062
01:35:01,186 --> 01:35:04,136
How is it so far?

1063
01:35:05,836 --> 01:35:09,046
Not so bad, except for the couple t-shirt.

1064
01:35:09,986 --> 01:35:11,576
What about you?

1065
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:18,096
That's my answer.

1066
01:35:20,986 --> 01:35:23,986
I heard you were preparing a new proposal.

1067
01:35:23,986 --> 01:35:27,116
Wow, you're so well-informed.

1068
01:35:27,116 --> 01:35:30,246
So what are you planning?

1069
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:31,676
It's a secret.

1070
01:35:31,676 --> 01:35:34,696
Tell me. I'm curious.

1071
01:35:34,696 --> 01:35:36,466
So you can trash it again?

1072
01:35:36,466 --> 01:35:38,126
Maybe.

1073
01:35:38,126 --> 01:35:41,546
I might be more critical if it sucks.

1074
01:35:41,546 --> 01:35:45,426
I'll have to do well to avoid your criticism.

1075
01:35:45,426 --> 01:35:47,566
But did I make you feel that insulted back then?

1076
01:35:47,566 --> 01:35:52,596
Yes. It was the most humiliating day ever since I came into the company.

1077
01:35:58,046 --> 01:36:01,276
I apologize. Please forgive me.

1078
01:36:07,259 --> 01:36:08,849
Let's toast to that.

1079
01:36:14,559 --> 01:36:17,289
- What a beautiful weather.
- Yeah.

[True love is having a welcoming heart, whenever, wherever, without any change]

1081
01:36:44,665 --> 01:36:46,885
What the... Didn't you go home?

1082
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:51,315
I did. I did, but... you wouldn't leave my mind.

1083
01:36:51,315 --> 01:36:53,695
You didn't eat dinner yet, right?

1084
01:36:53,695 --> 01:36:55,475
It's a hassle.

1085
01:36:57,015 --> 01:37:00,845
Do you mean that I'm a hassle, or that it's a hassle for me?

1086
01:37:01,735 --> 01:37:03,115
Both?

1087
01:37:04,175 --> 01:37:07,135
So aren't you happy to see me?

1088
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:09,055
I'm very happy.

1089
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:12,795
With words only? I want you to express yourself.

1090
01:37:12,795 --> 01:37:14,505
Oh, right.

1091
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,505
Look at this.

1092
01:37:30,745 --> 01:37:34,365
Okay, I believe you. It's so funny.

1093
01:37:37,655 --> 01:37:39,315
Oh? This!

[True love is having a welcoming heart, whenever, wherever, without any change]

1095
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:43,595
Isn't this what I said?

1096
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,535
So what?

1097
01:37:46,535 --> 01:37:48,655
I'll need to collect royalty fees.

1098
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:50,765
What are you saying?

1099
01:37:57,295 --> 01:38:01,955
Let me join the proposal. I'll give you my share.

1100
01:38:01,955 --> 01:38:04,015
You're kidding, right?

1101
01:38:04,015 --> 01:38:09,035
Working late with the person I like is on my bucket list.

1102
01:38:10,005 --> 01:38:14,095
I'm merciless. You're out as soon as you lose focus.

1103
01:38:14,725 --> 01:38:17,845
Of course, I'm just going to work. What are you imagining?

1104
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,615
I'm just saying.

1105
01:38:20,615 --> 01:38:23,765
Hurry and eat so we can get to work.

1106
01:38:25,865 --> 01:38:27,865
Are you serious?

1107
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:32,955
I'll help you. It's too much to do alone.

1108
01:38:35,265 --> 01:38:40,585
But if I suck, you can mercilessly criticize me, too. Deal?

1109
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:43,155
Deal.

1110
01:38:44,175 --> 01:38:46,795
Did you choose a title for your new proposal?

1111
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,685
It's too early. I don't even have a draft yet.

1112
01:38:49,685 --> 01:38:51,305
Really?

1113
01:38:51,305 --> 01:38:54,965
It's always easier for me when I begin with a title.

1114
01:38:54,965 --> 01:38:57,195
Just like...

1115

1116
01:39:01,595 --> 01:39:05,725
I see. It would be nice to begin with a title.

1117
01:39:14,215 --> 01:39:16,295

1118
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:28,555
Jeong Ha Ram.

1119
01:39:31,045 --> 01:39:35,055
Jeong Ha Ram. Don't sleep here. Go home.

1120
01:39:39,105 --> 01:39:41,025
Are you done?

1121
01:39:41,025 --> 01:39:43,955
I still have a little more left.

1122
01:39:43,955 --> 01:39:47,095
Let me know when you're done. I'll take you home.

1123
01:39:47,095 --> 01:39:48,865
I can take a taxi home.

1124
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:51,665
Go home before the last bus.

1125
01:39:51,665 --> 01:39:54,965
Then I'll just take the taxi with you to your house.

1126
01:39:58,205 --> 01:39:59,775
My house?

1127
01:39:59,775 --> 01:40:02,795
There you go again with your dirty thoughts.

1128
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:05,125
Anyway, just wake me up.

1129
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:09,025
I worked too hard today, so I'm out of it.

1130
01:41:31,495 --> 01:41:33,055
Hand.

1131
01:41:35,725 --> 01:41:37,565
Hand!

1132
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:43,515
Why?

1133
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:45,475
Let's hold hands and sleep.

1134
01:42:25,955 --> 01:42:30,335
I can hear your heart really well.

1135
01:42:31,595 --> 01:42:34,305
Should we just take the day off tomorrow?

1136
01:42:34,955 --> 01:42:37,215
I'm suddenly wide awake.

1137
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:41,015
What will we do instead of sleeping?

1138
01:42:41,015 --> 01:42:43,735
What you kept thinking about.

1139
01:42:44,985 --> 01:42:47,805
I did not think anything like that.

1140
01:42:47,805 --> 01:42:50,295
Then what I kept thinking about.

1141
01:42:51,595 --> 01:42:55,935
Let's go to sleep. We'll really be late tomorrow.

1142
01:42:57,675 --> 01:42:59,435
All right.

1143
01:43:01,485 --> 01:43:03,355

1312
01:59:54,224 --> 01:59:56,324
What the hell are you doing?

1313
01:59:58,034 --> 02:00:00,974
Do you know that it has been three years since we saw each other?

1314
02:00:01,614 --> 02:00:06,144
These are your favorite lisianthus flowers.

1315
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:19,594
- Have you seen Team Leader Seo?
- No, I haven't.

1316
02:00:28,084 --> 02:00:30,324
I don't need these.

1317
02:00:33,294 --> 02:00:36,534
Seo Yi Jun! Seo Yi Jun!

1318
02:00:38,494 --> 02:00:41,014
I really missed you.

1319
02:00:41,014 --> 02:00:46,134
After seeing your name on "True Love's" proposal, I kept thinking about you.

1320
02:00:46,134 --> 02:00:50,394
To be honest, I made this decision because of you.

1321
02:00:51,304 --> 02:00:53,664
Although I don't think you would believe me.

1322
02:00:54,334 --> 02:00:58,074
Funny. Who said I was casting you?

1323
02:00:58,934 --> 02:01:03,924
Yi Jun, I have something I must tell you.

1324
02:01:03,924 --> 02:01:07,104
- Can you make some time?
- Why should I?

1325
02:01:07,104 --> 02:01:09,104
Don't you know we're strangers now?

1326
02:01:09,104 --> 02:01:11,834
Your anger is understandable.

1327
02:01:11,834 --> 02:01:16,514
But it wasn't... all bad between us.

1328
02:01:16,514 --> 02:01:18,184
Do you have no shame?

1329
02:01:18,184 --> 02:01:20,514
How dare you show up in front of me?

1330
02:01:20,514 --> 02:01:23,194
I know I'm being shameless.

1331
02:01:24,024 --> 02:01:26,754
So I want to be different this time.

1332
02:01:39,834 --> 02:01:44,354
I'll wait... until you forgive me.

1335
02:02:35,834 --> 02:02:39,304
Why do I feel so conflicted?

1336
02:02:39,304 --> 02:02:41,834
I should just ignore him.

1337

But it's hard to.

1338

Can I go over to your place today?

1339
02:02:53,651 --> 02:02:56,421
I'm tired. Next time.

1340
02:03:07,261 --> 02:03:09,121
What?

1341
02:03:09,881 --> 02:03:12,081
What's so tiring?

1342

What's gotten into you?

1343
02:03:19,534 --> 02:03:21,214
What about me?

1344
02:03:21,214 --> 02:03:23,964
It feels like you've been interrogating me for some time now.

1345
02:03:23,964 --> 02:03:25,954
It's getting on my nerves.

1346

Then do something to get rid of that feeling.

1347
02:03:32,154 --> 02:03:35,824
Are you saying I'm hiding something from you?

1348
02:03:37,204 --> 02:03:38,804
Aren't you?

1349
02:03:47,624 --> 02:03:49,544
Hyeong, you go ahead.

1350
02:03:50,964 --> 02:03:54,064
- What about you?
- Don't worry about it.

1351
02:03:55,104 --> 02:03:57,964

Yes? What?

1354
02:04:12,834 --> 02:04:15,394
Could I talk to you for a moment?

1355
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:18,814
All of a sudden? What's wrong?

1356
02:04:20,194 --> 02:04:21,764
Well...

1357
02:04:43,984 --> 02:04:47,884
- What?
- I'm seeing Team Leader Seo.

1358
02:04:53,644 --> 02:04:57,644
Are you the one Team Leader Seo was seeing?

1359
02:04:57,644 --> 02:05:01,654
Yes, with good feelings.

1360
02:05:01,654 --> 02:05:03,844
Oh my goodness.

1361
02:05:04,524 --> 02:05:07,034
Anyway, go on.

1362
02:05:07,034 --> 02:05:11,184
Well... we're not really in a relationship yet.

1363
02:05:11,184 --> 02:05:12,964
We're just date mates.

1364
02:05:12,964 --> 02:05:15,254
Date mates?

1365
02:05:15,884 --> 02:05:17,504
What's this about now?

1366
02:05:17,504 --> 02:05:20,794
We're seeing each other under the limit of one month.

1367
02:05:20,794 --> 02:05:23,544
But there's suddenly a problem.

1368
02:05:23,544 --> 02:05:25,674
What problem?

1369
02:05:26,514 --> 02:05:31,114
Someone interfered in the middle.

1370
02:05:31,114 --> 02:05:34,144
Interfered? Who?

1371
02:05:34,144 --> 02:05:36,084
My guess is...

1372
02:05:39,434 --> 02:05:42,464
Team Leader Seo's ex-boyfriend.

1373
02:05:42,464 --> 02:05:45,654
What is this? A soap opera?

1374
02:05:45,654 --> 02:05:49,224
But Team Leader Seo won't tell me anything.

1375
02:05:49,224 --> 02:05:54,394
I was going to feign ignorance and just overlook it, but...

1376
02:05:54,394 --> 02:05:57,984
I am concerned and anxious.

1377
02:05:57,984 --> 02:06:00,224
The biggest question is...

1378
02:06:00,224 --> 02:06:03,184
if I have the right to speak up.

1379
02:06:04,144 --> 02:06:07,294
Our date mate duration is coming to an end soon.

1380
02:06:07,294 --> 02:06:09,684
I don't want to ruin it all with a mistake.

1381
02:06:09,684 --> 02:06:12,574
So I have a lot on my mind.

1382
02:06:14,004 --> 02:06:17,674
Just be honest.

1383
02:06:17,674 --> 02:06:21,224
You call yourselves date mates, but you're basically in a relationship.

1384
02:06:21,224 --> 02:06:22,824
Am I wrong?

1385
02:06:22,824 --> 02:06:25,044
That's true.

1386
02:06:25,044 --> 02:06:26,644
You idiots.

1387
02:06:26,644 --> 02:06:29,224
You guys started with the wrong context.

1388
02:06:29,224 --> 02:06:32,854
If you like each other, just date. Why be date mates?

1389
02:06:32,854 --> 02:06:35,004
If it doesn't work out after the period is over,

1390
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:37,854
could you just say your goodbyes?

1391
02:06:39,334 --> 02:06:40,644
Dear...

1392
02:06:40,644 --> 02:06:46,264
what do you think the biggest obstacle is when you like someone?

1393
02:06:49,504 --> 02:06:51,984
I'm not sure.

1394
02:06:51,984 --> 02:06:53,714
It's fear.

1395
02:06:54,334 --> 02:06:58,884
Go on and have an honest talk with Team Leader Seo.

1396
02:06:59,814 --> 02:07:01,384
Right now!

1397
02:07:01,384 --> 02:07:02,814
Okay.

1398
02:07:24,064 --> 02:07:26,794
Don't beat around the bush and get to the point.

1399
02:07:26,794 --> 02:07:29,094
What do you need to tell me?

1400
02:07:29,094 --> 02:07:30,624
I'm sorry.

1401
02:07:32,174 --> 02:07:35,594
I wanted to talk to you face to face.

1402
02:07:35,594 --> 02:07:40,464
Yi Jun, I was too disrespectful to you, wasn't I?

1403
02:07:41,514 --> 02:07:43,304
After all this time?

1404
02:07:43,914 --> 02:07:46,644
I guess, after all this time.

1405
02:07:47,702 --> 02:07:51,104
It's late, but could you forgive me?

1406
02:07:51,104 --> 02:07:53,874
What difference will that make?

1407
02:07:56,114 --> 02:07:58,934
I want to get along with you again.

1408
02:08:04,914 --> 02:08:07,844
You keep counting your eggs before they hatch.

1409
02:08:07,844 --> 02:08:09,524
That's not happening.

1410
02:08:11,824 --> 02:08:14,524
I know it's not easy.

1411
02:08:14,524 --> 02:08:17,264
And I know what I've done to you.

1412
02:08:17,264 --> 02:08:19,864
You did everything for me.

1413
02:08:21,434 --> 02:08:23,644
When I said I wanted to model,

1414
02:08:23,644 --> 02:08:28,124
you fed my vanity with shoes and clothes.

1415
02:08:28,854 --> 02:08:31,284
And since I was jobless and loafing around at home,

1416
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:36,204
you introduced a part-time job to me and also managed my diet.

1417
02:08:36,204 --> 02:08:39,764
And... when I failed an audition,

1418
02:08:39,764 --> 02:08:44,564
you always cheered me on in case I lost self-esteem.

1419
02:08:44,564 --> 02:08:49,584
I remember every single thing you've done for me.

1420
02:08:49,584 --> 02:08:53,974
To be honest, you're the one who made me who I am today.

1421
02:08:54,584 --> 02:09:00,674
I'm really grateful for that... and sorry.

1422

And you still did that?

1423
02:09:04,994 --> 02:09:08,334
You still made me feel that miserable?

1424
02:09:08,334 --> 02:09:12,064
I've forgotten all my memories with you.

1425

1427
02:09:19,614 --> 02:09:24,404
Sure. It must be easy for you. But I...

1428
02:09:27,064 --> 02:09:29,564
Forget it. Let's stop here.

1429
02:09:30,954 --> 02:09:33,314
I'm really regretful.

1430
02:09:34,094 --> 02:09:37,654
Please let me repay everything you've done for me.

1431

Is it because of the program?

Do you think I would... approach you with ulterior motives?

1435

I just...

1436

02:12:07,179 --> 02:12:09,649
That Yun Do Kyeong was bothering you.

1464
02:12:10,619 --> 02:12:13,589
It has nothing to do with you.

1465

It has nothing to do with me?

Right.

This wouldn't have happened if you had been honest with me.

02:12:45,129 --> 02:12:50,829
Being whipped around by my ex... was too pathetic.

1473
02:12:50,829 --> 02:12:53,119
So I hid it.

1474
02:12:53,989 --> 02:12:58,789
I was honestly going to properly end things with Yun Do Kyeong today.

1475
02:13:00,519 --> 02:13:03,189
But you appeared out of nowhere

1476
02:13:04,109 --> 02:13:06,179
and everything was messed up.

1477
02:13:07,099 --> 02:13:10,199
I've been extremely embarrassed to see you.

1478
02:13:13,469 --> 02:13:18,189
I realized something while looking at the two of you.

1479
02:13:19,129 --> 02:13:20,609
What?

1480
02:13:22,219 --> 02:13:28,589
I'm still... not ready to like anyone.

1481
02:13:30,389 --> 02:13:34,589
It's not anyone's fault. It's all my fault.

1482
02:13:37,089 --> 02:13:42,889
Honestly, I didn't tell you because a part of me doesn't trust you.

1483
02:13:43,589 --> 02:13:46,799
I was afraid I would become petty.

1484
02:13:49,899 --> 02:13:55,329
I am afraid that fear... won't be easy to overcome.

1485
02:13:56,899 --> 02:14:02,009
And I don't want you to get hurt because of me.

1486
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:11,659
Let's just... end things here.

1487
02:14:13,329 --> 02:14:16,339
We became date mates...

1488
02:14:16,339 --> 02:14:19,319
because of my fear in the first place.

1489
02:14:24,089 --> 02:14:28,709
Let's stop being date mates.

1490
02:14:31,259 --> 02:14:33,889
Nothing makes sense.

1491
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:40,309
It's tough to sort out my feelings... and it's tough for you, too.

1492
02:14:41,929 --> 02:14:44,039
Let's just end it here.

1493
02:15:52,589 --> 02:15:56,299
Team Leader Seo, did you make up your mind about DK?

1494
02:15:56,299 --> 02:15:59,449
Writer Jin is totally okay with him.

1495
02:16:00,249 --> 02:16:01,629
Yes.

1496
02:16:05,559 --> 02:16:09,109
- Let's cast DK.
- What?

1497
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:13,449
He's a hot topic and the best choice in terms of strategy.

1498
02:16:13,449 --> 02:16:17,689
And above all, he has a strong will, so let's trust it.

1499
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:34,349
- What are you doing?
- Jeong Ha Ram.

1500
02:16:34,349 --> 02:16:38,059
We're at work. What are you doing?

1501
02:16:38,059 --> 02:16:42,789
What are you thinking, trying to cast Yun Do Kyeong? Huh?

1502
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:46,089
Do you want him to keep bothering you?

1503
02:16:46,089 --> 02:16:50,809
Being hung up on my feelings is bothersome and a burden.

1504
02:16:50,809 --> 02:16:53,509
I'm just going to go with the flow.

1505
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:55,909
And Yun Do Kyeong is a candidate for casting.

1506
02:16:55,909 --> 02:16:57,989
He's literally the best.

1507
02:16:57,989 --> 02:17:00,479
I don't want to make things harder by overthinking.

1508
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,549
The same goes for you.

1509
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:04,829
Can you really do that?

1510
02:17:07,159 --> 02:17:08,879
Even to me?

1511
02:17:11,129 --> 02:17:12,939
For three years...

1512
02:17:13,589 --> 02:17:16,829
I met people through apps without any feelings.

1513
02:17:17,719 --> 02:17:20,379
Things were nice and comfortable then.

1514
02:17:20,379 --> 02:17:22,649
I'll go back to that.

1515
02:17:23,249 --> 02:17:26,149
So don't make me uncomfortable like this.

1516
02:17:32,629 --> 02:17:37,179
We should have... never started to begin with.

1517
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,989
All right. Yun Do Kyeong is here to join us for "True Love."

1518
02:17:53,989 --> 02:17:55,869
Applause!

1519
02:17:55,869 --> 02:17:57,629
Welcome!

1520
02:17:57,629 --> 02:18:00,269
Thank you in advance. I'm Yun Do Kyeong.

1521
02:18:00,269 --> 02:18:02,379
Please take good care of him.

1522
02:18:02,379 --> 02:18:04,609
And we can't just go home on a day like this, right?

1523
02:18:04,609 --> 02:18:09,159
Let's go for a team dinner. Pack your things and follow me!

1524
02:18:11,629 --> 02:18:15,369
Yi Jun. Do you have a moment?

1525
02:18:50,019 --> 02:18:51,659
I heard what happened.

1526
02:18:51,659 --> 02:18:54,599
I got cast because you gave the okay.

1527
02:18:54,599 --> 02:18:56,129
Thanks.

1528
02:18:58,669 --> 02:19:00,839
Let's do our best.

1529
02:19:00,839 --> 02:19:03,859
You're the only one who looks out for me.

1530
02:19:06,059 --> 02:19:08,529
I just went along with the company.

1531
02:19:08,529 --> 02:19:10,919
Don't put unnecessary meaning to it.

1532
02:19:11,629 --> 02:19:14,229
And let's keep it professional from now on.

1533
02:19:14,229 --> 02:19:16,169
With all due respect.

1534
02:19:16,949 --> 02:19:20,179
You got it, Team Leader Seo.

1535
02:19:21,509 --> 02:19:23,989
I'm repeating myself, but

1536
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:27,189
I don't have personal feelings for you at all.

1537
02:19:27,189 --> 02:19:32,349
Don't get on my nerves by bringing up the past.

1538
02:19:32,349 --> 02:19:36,909
How could I? We've known each other for years.

1539
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:38,599
Please do.

1540
02:19:38,599 --> 02:19:41,489
Do Kyeong, let's go.

1541
02:19:43,569 --> 02:19:46,929
Anyway, let's grab dinner sometime.

1542
02:19:46,929 --> 02:19:49,549
I found a really nice place.

1543
02:20:19,289 --> 02:20:21,949
I forgot to give him the draft of our contract.

1544
02:20:21,949 --> 02:20:24,989
Go take it to DK. He's probably in the underground parking lot right now.

1545
02:20:24,989 --> 02:20:28,329
Me? You can tell his manager to come up.

1546
02:20:28,329 --> 02:20:31,309
He's not picking up. Go on.

1547
02:20:31,309 --> 02:20:33,799
Geez, seriously.

1548
02:20:33,799 --> 02:20:36,149
You always make me do these things.

1549
02:20:43,999 --> 02:20:47,469
Always making me do everything. What a hassle.

1550
02:20:49,199 --> 02:20:50,519
Such a bother.

1551
02:20:50,519 --> 02:20:52,429
Yes, CEO.

1552
02:20:53,079 --> 02:20:56,279
Of course. I introduced myself to everyone.

1553
02:20:56,999 --> 02:21:00,209
Oh, the friend who created the proposal?

1554
02:21:00,209 --> 02:21:04,359
What should I do? I've got him in the palm of my hand.

1555
02:21:05,339 --> 02:21:09,859
Please. He does everything I ask him to.

1556
02:21:09,859 --> 02:21:12,049
He's naive, like a fool.

1557
02:21:12,049 --> 02:21:16,139
It shouldn't be a problem if I just keep at it.

1558
02:21:16,139 --> 02:21:17,629
Yes.

1559
02:21:18,339 --> 02:21:22,439
Come on, CEO. It's a done deal, so quit worrying.

1560
02:21:22,439 --> 02:21:23,979
Yes.

1561
02:21:24,789 --> 02:21:27,489
It's all thanks to you.

1562
02:21:31,689 --> 02:21:33,309
Don't.

1563
02:21:43,839 --> 02:21:45,379
Hyeong.

1564
02:21:47,809 --> 02:21:49,449
Let's just go back up.

1565
02:21:49,449 --> 02:21:50,819
Why?

1566
02:21:51,569 --> 02:21:53,899
Why are you turning a blind eye?

1567
02:21:56,529 --> 02:21:59,569
Aren't you angry that he manipulated you?

1568
02:22:00,849 --> 02:22:03,319
Just let it be.

1569
02:22:03,319 --> 02:22:04,889
Going up.

1570
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:08,339
The door is closing.

1571
02:22:18,032 --> 02:22:20,142
I'm going crazy.

1572
02:22:20,142 --> 02:22:23,162
Why isn't he picking up?

1573
02:22:23,162 --> 02:22:25,472
What's going on with Team Leader Seo?

1574
02:22:25,472 --> 02:22:29,222
He's still not at work yet. Did he contact anyone?

1575
02:22:29,872 --> 02:22:31,462
Did no one hear from him?

1576
02:22:31,462 --> 02:22:34,022
Give him a call and see if he's okay.

1577
02:22:34,022 --> 02:22:36,092
This isn't like him.

1578
02:22:38,689 --> 02:22:42,749
I'm a relationship virgin, like you said.

1579
02:22:42,749 --> 02:22:45,169
And I am fragile.

1580
02:22:45,169 --> 02:22:47,599
Nothing makes sense.

1581
02:22:49,189 --> 02:22:54,519
It's tough to sort out my feelings... and it's tough for you, too.

1582
02:22:54,519 --> 02:22:56,679
Let's just end it here.

1583
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:01,749
- Manager.
- Yes.

1584
02:23:01,749 --> 02:23:05,009
- I have to go off site.
- Sure, go ahead.

1585
02:23:07,839 --> 02:23:09,599
Go off site?

1586
02:23:14,809 --> 02:23:18,659
Hyeong! Yi Jun Hyeong!

1587
02:23:25,799 --> 02:23:27,299
What?

1588
02:23:32,379 --> 02:23:36,669
Why did you come? What about work?

1589
02:23:36,669 --> 02:23:39,079
Do you think work is the problem?

1590
02:23:39,079 --> 02:23:41,379
Where does it hurt?

1591
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:45,619
Just... I'm just not in good condition.

1592
02:23:45,619 --> 02:23:47,259
It's nothing serious.

1593
02:23:48,339 --> 02:23:50,029
You're lying.

1594
02:23:51,709 --> 02:23:53,739
You're hurting here.

1595
02:23:59,069 --> 02:24:01,249
Meet with Yun Do Kyeong.

1596
02:24:06,929 --> 02:24:10,549
Meet him and curse him out or argue.

1597
02:24:10,549 --> 02:24:14,789
Don't hold back the pain, and don't avoid it.

1598
02:24:14,789 --> 02:24:19,009
Don't be afraid and pour out the feelings you stashed away.

1599
02:24:19,009 --> 02:24:20,789
Forget it.

1600
02:24:21,629 --> 02:24:25,709
Doing that won't change anything.

1601
02:24:25,709 --> 02:24:28,179
Why not?

1602
02:24:28,179 --> 02:24:31,369
Don't let him look down on you anymore.

1603
02:24:31,369 --> 02:24:33,099
And I...

1604
02:24:35,449 --> 02:24:38,289
I don't want you to close up again.

1605
02:24:44,352 --> 02:24:49,152
Expressing and receiving emotions is difficult for me, too.

1606
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:51,752
Other people are the same.

1607
02:24:51,752 --> 02:24:57,032
We learn from the pain and all the while, we keep at it.

1608
02:24:58,612 --> 02:25:01,362
Running away isn't the answer, Hyeong.

1609
02:25:02,052 --> 02:25:04,772
I know it's not the answer.

1610
02:25:05,802 --> 02:25:08,862
But it's not the wrong answer either.

1611
02:25:08,862 --> 02:25:10,382
No.

1612
02:25:11,452 --> 02:25:14,172
It's wrong to me, and it's awful.

1613
02:25:15,122 --> 02:25:19,332
I can't watch the person I like struggle with the wrong answer.

1614
02:25:22,082 --> 02:25:27,332
If it's hard to do this alone, I'll stay beside you.

1615
02:25:28,642 --> 02:25:33,422
To be honest, I was confident.

1616
02:25:34,502 --> 02:25:36,992
But I couldn't figure out how.

1617
02:25:37,882 --> 02:25:40,192
I was at a loss.

1618
02:25:41,112 --> 02:25:44,122
Pretending you weren't the one...

1619
02:25:45,082 --> 02:25:47,812
and pushing you away...

1620
02:25:49,752 --> 02:25:52,232
I kept thinking of you

1621
02:25:52,872 --> 02:25:57,792
and remembered the times we spent together.

1622
02:26:03,752 --> 02:26:06,002
I'm awful, aren't I?

1623
02:26:07,152 --> 02:26:10,842
Yeah. You're awful.

1624
02:26:10,842 --> 02:26:13,172
You're really awful.

1625
02:26:13,172 --> 02:26:18,792
But I'm awful, too. For not understanding you.

1626
02:26:23,162 --> 02:26:25,782
Let's not be like this anymore.

1627
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:36,532
Don't be nervous. Be honest.

1628
02:26:36,532 --> 02:26:38,182
All right?

1629
02:26:38,912 --> 02:26:41,042
I'll do my best.

1630
02:26:47,112 --> 02:26:49,102
Yi Jun, you're here.

1631
02:26:52,572 --> 02:26:54,092
