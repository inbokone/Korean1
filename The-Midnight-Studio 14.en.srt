00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
You can't look at someone else's phone. Give it to me.

171
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,090
Just once. I'll change it to something better.

172
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,470
But I like this.

173
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,100
L-Let me pass, My Mr. Seo.

174
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,710
What are you doing in a public space?

175
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,390
My Bom.

176
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,180
Hold on. The safe zone didn't activate just now, right?

177
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,340
You're right.

178
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,690
What's with you? You killed me, and then you revived me.

179
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,080
How did this...

180
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,720
Thinking about it now, nothing made much sense.

181
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,530
How could my uncle, who was supposed to be wandering
[Missing person - Seo Ki Won, male, 35 years old]

182
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,360
in the netherworld, come to meet me

183
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,360
in a space that's already gone?

184
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,610
We were neither dead nor alive.

185
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,400
How were we able to take photos?

186
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,230
Unbelievable things that happened

187
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,610
ever since the camera came to this world from the netherworld.

188
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,640
I decided to call all of those things miracles.

189
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,760
Yes, got it.

190
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,700
[Assemblywoman Kim Mi Hye]

191
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,890
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...

192
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,290
Your son was transferred to the detention center.

193
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,270
- How about Assemblywoman Kim?
- She can't be reached.

194
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,780
Both Assemblymen Park and Choi are also letting their secretaries answer.

195
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,030
Saying they're not feeling well.

196
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,760
Minister, the president wants to hear your answer

197
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,790
because the petitions keep posting.

198
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,320
Kim Seong Soo's body was found in the suitcase you moved.

199
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,790
Will you keep denying the charge?

200
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,260
Where's my father?

201
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,070
I requested him many times. Is he still not here yet?

202
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,270
Do you think my father would do nothing if he found out

203
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,440
you prohibited me from contacting him?

204
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,010
Your father rejected our call, okay?

205
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,830
I see. I guess you don't know since you've been in the detention center.

206
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,370
[Minister Lee will let his son be punished for his crimes. He apologizes as a public servant.]

207
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:06,080
[When asked if he was aware of his crimes, he answered, "I had no idea."]

208
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Do you really think Father didn't know anything?

209
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,850
[This way]

210
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,460
What's this?

211
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,830
Who did all this...

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,260
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,120
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

- Happy, happy birthday!

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,590
- What's all this?
- Make a wish, Mr. Seo.

Oh, right. Let's eat before it gets cold.

225
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,050
Come in.

226
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,020
Aigoo...

227
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,070
You need to wear this because it's your birthday.

228
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,350
- How pretty.
- No!

229
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,850
Hold on. Sit further away from each other.

230
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,070
Oh, right. The safe zone doesn't work anymore.

231
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,570
Oh, I see.

232
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,050
You're right.

233
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,250
That's more the reason to stay closer.

234
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,770
We did grocery shopping, prepped ingredients, and decorated the room since this morning.

235
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,670
Do you know how hard we worked?

236
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,060
I was in charge of cooking.

237
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,510
Bom didn't do anything, then.

238
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,190
I didn't do anything?

239
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,070
Mr. Seo, don't you see all this stuff?

240
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,940
Every little thing that I worked hard to decorate. My gift to you.

241
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,210
I worked so hard on all this.

242
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,920
How cool.

243
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,720
Mr. Seo,

244
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,060
let's stop being so dark and depressing. Let's live brightly.

245
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,090
We'll wake up and go to bed at normal times, too.

246
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,870
- Ta-da.
- Whoa.

247
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,720
It's a birthday present.

248
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,190
It's a pocketknife made from a tree that lightning struck.

249
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,120
It'd be easy to carry since it's compact.

250
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,870
Don't get stabbed by anyone from now on.

251
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,740
Lee Seon Ho suddenly lunged at me then...

252
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,820
Anyway, thank you.

253
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,410
- I sent my present via message.
- Huh?

254
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,390
Getting a reservation here is harder than registering for a college course.

255
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,430
I possessed five people at a PC cafe to pull it off.

256
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:03,410
Mr. Seo, go out to get tasty food like normal people from now on.

257
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,730
Live a long and healthy life.

258
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,790
Thank you.

259
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,700
Right, right. I forgot to give this to you.

260
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,550
- How could you forget that?
- Seriously.

261
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,260
Birthday punishment!

262
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,710
So cute.

263
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,750
Come on.

264
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,130
I told you not to be rude to him! I knew you'd get punished...

265
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,540
Come here, my little brother. Let me give you a peck.

266
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,220
It still feels awkward.

267
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,820
It feels bright and warm, like a normal house.

268
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,680
Let's get used to things one by one.

269
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,040
Oh, I wanted to pick a pink wallpaper, but I held back.

270
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,670
Because I thought you might faint.

271
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,040
You'd better not do that. Seriously.

272
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,590
Oh, right. Hold on.

273
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,740
Here you go.

274
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,950
It's my last present.

275
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,640
What is it?

276
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,820
Thank you.

277
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,740
By the way,

278
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,020
they say if you gift someone shoes, they run away.

279
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm giving them to you so you can run away.

280
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,250
Wear these and run far away.

281
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,810
From the studio, curse, and death.

282
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,210
Run very far away.

283
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,650
So they can't chase you again.

284
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,730
What if I actually run far away?

285
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,120
These shoes come with one condition.

286
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,030
Condition?

287
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,060
No matter how far away you go, you have to go with me.

288
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,610
Whether it's the Pitcairn Islands or somewhere further,

289
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,730
I'll go with you.

290
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,410
I no longer need to go to the Pitcairn Islands.

291
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,150
Gosh, you must be tired.

292
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,300
We must've stayed too long.

293
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,960
They said patients need to rest in body and soul.

294
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,940
Mr. Seo, I really wish you a happy birthday.

295
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,590
I'll leave now.

296
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,090
No...

297
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,990
I'm not tired at all.

298
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,550
No, no, you're tired. I'll leave.

299
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,520
Mr. Seo, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

300
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,230
The wound must've opened. Let me see.

301
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,770
What? Were you tricking me?

302
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,460
No.

303
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,590
It really hurt,

304
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,100
but I think I feel fine now.

305
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,210
Hey, Seo Ki Joo.

♫ Oh, I love you ♫

309
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,070
Resting body and soul is important.

310
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,760
- This is no good.
- Pardon?

311
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,520
Should we rest our body and soul starting now?

312
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,250
W-What do you mean... What?

313
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,080
Hold on. Hold on.

314
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,200
- I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet-
- No, Mr. Seo.

315
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,500
- We no longer need to wait to be ready.
- No.

316
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,310
Seriously, you can't fool me.

317
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,190
Hold on. Hold on.

318
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,510
The seal. The seal.

319
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,520
Let me have a look.

320
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,960
The seal is getting faint.

321
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,490
The curse really must be ending.

322
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,520
While you were at the hospital after waking up,

323
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,730
no visitors came to the studio.

324
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,060
The seal is starting to fade away, too.

325
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,190
Maybe the evil spirit disappeared because you're past 35 years old now.

326
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,420
That must've been the reason the evil spirit existed.

327
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,140
I searched everywhere after it left Lee Seon Ho,

328
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,110
but I couldn't find its trace anywhere.

329
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,880
Everything that's been torturing me is disappearing.

330
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,270
Disappearing.

331
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,640
Yes, the safe zone didn't activate at the hospital, either.

332
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,330
Maybe that's disappearing, too, since the curse is ending.

333
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,780
Ta-da!

334
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,630
How do I look today?

335
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,880
Where did you get those clothes-

336
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,380
- Did you use my card-
- No, no, no.

337
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,690
I-I bought it on Cucumber Market.

338
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,890
With my own money.

339
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,610
- Where are you going?
- I have a girlfriend. What else?

340
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,830
I'm going on a date.

341
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,900
By the way, what were you two talking about?

342
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,710
The curse seems to be ending.

343
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,070
Which means the studio is about to close, too.

344
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,430
You two should also prepare to leave this world.

345
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,830
What are you doing?

346
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,190
Mr. Seo, I'm ready.

347
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,250
You can take your time to think about it.

348
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,250
I should've left a long time ago.

349
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,140
Your decision hasn't changed since last time?

350
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,110
No. Before that,

351
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,030
I'd like you to let me see Goo Min Hyeon.

352
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,340
Did you wait long?

353
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm sorry, I had to close the shop in a hurry.

354
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,550
By the way, I didn't think you'd contact me first.

355
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,580
I wanted to give you this.

356
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,380
Na Rae...

357
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,490
It won't be as good as the seaweed soup you made me,

358
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,840
but I'm sure it's pretty good.

359
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,390
I'm a pretty good cook.

360
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,010
It's not even my birthday.

361
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,040
Thank you. I'll finish every last drop of it.

362
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,000
It's a goodbye present.

363
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,690
I don't think I could see you off.

364
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
Thanks to your affection,

365
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,890
I've felt your warmth.

366
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,100
I'm sorry this is all I can give you.

367
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,730
It's okay to take your time to give me the answer.

368
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,250
My answer will always be the same.

369
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,580
We should really part ways now.

370
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,550
[My Destiny]

371
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,350
[- See you at seven, Ji Won.
- Yes, Seong Ho.]

372
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,320
You've got something there. Aigoo, aigoo.

373
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,820
Do I...

374
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,880
really have to leave?

375
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,780
I'm sorry, Seong Ho. Chief Kim is making me work overtime.

376
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,540
I won't be able to meet you tonight.

377
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,110
Chief Kim, that son of a bitch.

378
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,930
Your internship is ending soon, right?

379
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,360
You got the perfect score on the HR review.

380
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm sure you'll get hired full-time if you wrap this up well.

381
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,100
Fighting!

382
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,710
Of course. I'll work hard.

383
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,420
Great.

384
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,280
I like how you work hard on everything, Ji Won.

385
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,210
I'll leave you to it, then.

386
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,490
- Well, Deputy.
- Yes.

387
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:36,150
Do you have a photo of the late Go Seong Ho, by the way?

388
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,320
You said you joined the company the same year.

389
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,890
I'm not sure if I have a photo of someone who died three years ago.

390
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,900
But what about Mr. Go?

391
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,810
Just because.

392
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,790
I wanted to see...

393
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,710
how handsome he was.

394
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,490
See you.

395
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,450
Here's food delivery.

396
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,820
Huh? What are you doing here?

397
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,020
I had to come because you're busy.

398
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,990
By the way, it's been almost 10 minutes. I need to go-

399
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,040
Hold on. Where are you going?

400
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Send the delivery guy away and eat with me.

401
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,840
I don't want to eat alone.

402
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,460
But, I-

403
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,310
It's okay.

404
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,250
It's okay if I can't see you.

405
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,260
You just need to be by my side.

406
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,760
Because that's the real you.

407
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:46,520
You two should also prepare to leave this world.

408
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,140
I'll let him go quickly and be right back. Wait.

409
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,670
Welcome.

410
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,070
Welcome-

411
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,240
You've been here before, haven't you?

412
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,670
You know Mr. Baek Nam Goo, right?

413
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,400
Baek Nam Goo?

414
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,360
Ms. Jin Na Rae's husband.

415
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,970
The late Mr. Baek wants to tell you something before he leaves.

416
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,250
What kind of ridiculous thing is that to say?

417
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,070
A ghost?

418
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,180
Whether you believe me or not...

419
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,250
is up to you.

420
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,800
It's because there's no one else

421
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,910
who could care for Na Rae.

422
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,160
Whether you believe me or not is up to you.

423
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,330
It's because there's no one else who could care for Na Rae.

424
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,250
Although I was a bad husband,

425
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,000
she'd need some time to move on.

426
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,320
So, although it might be difficult,

427
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,220
give her time and wait.

428
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,700
Although I was a bad husband, she'd need some time to move on.

429
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,340
So, although it might be difficult, give her time and wait.

430
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,810
I'm not sure what you're talking about now-

431
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,840
Let her go on a trip once a year, at least.

432
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,860
She likes to travel.

433
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,290
She likes watching movies.

434
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,830
Watch a lot of them with her, too.

435
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,030
She doesn't like eating alone.

436
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,480
So eat with her, too.

437
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,860
- Excuse me.
- Don't gift her flowers too often.

438
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,650
She actually doesn't like flowers.

439
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,030
Sir, please leave now.

440
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,130
Whenever she needed me,

441
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,550
I was never by her side.

442
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,140
I hope you don't make the same mistake.

443
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,710
And...

444
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,240
make her smile a lot.

445
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,170
Gosh, what's the deal?

446
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,910
I thought you'd have a fistfight or something.

447
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,480
You should've been a man and punched him.

448
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,930
A police officer doesn't assault citizens.

449
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,450
Okay.

450
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,280
By the way, you really don't need to see her before you go?

451
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,800
You couldn't leave because you wanted to see her.

452
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,560
I don't want Na Rae to be in more pain.

453
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,950
That's also the reason I stayed.

454
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,470
I'll see Lee Seon Ho being punished and be on my way.

455
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,520
and be on my way.

456
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,940
Lee, a police officer who got arrested for murder

457
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,310
criticized his father, Lee Hyeon Oh,

458
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,740
the minister of justice for concealing the evidence for his crime.

459
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,330
While Minister Lee is strongly denying the claim

460
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,930
and Officer Lee is continuously arguing back at him,

461
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,760
the prosecution summoned a witness

462
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,480
including Officer Lee for a cross interrogation.

463
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,120
We'll start the cross-interrogation.

464
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,180
Suspect, is it true that you've been concealing the evidence of

465
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,130
Lee Seon Ho's murders of Kang Hyeong Il and Jo Seong Tae using your authority?

466
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,690
No.

467
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,740
I didn't know my son committed murders, either.

468
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,160
Yes, that's correct.

469
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,080
The suspect, a chief prosecutor at the time,

470
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,450
hid the fact that there is a back door at the vacation home in the initial investigation

471
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,460
and he pressured me, a prosecutor at the time,

472
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,750
to close the case quickly.

473
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,430
All the evidence was pointing at Kim Yoon Cheol then.

474
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,350
How about the Jangjin Tunnel case in 2003?

475
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:18,160
I killed three people by mistake that day.

476
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,990
There were two accidents in total.

477
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,320
Seo Ki Won, who tried to save me...

478
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,350
was killed outside the tunnel.

479
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,680
You were the one who covered everything up, Father.

480
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,900
Look up the case.

481
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,530
You'll see that Kang Hyeong Il went to prison in my place.

482
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:43,990
You don't believe a high school student took care of everything, right?

483
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,610
You bastard.

484
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,350
I worked so hard to come this far.

485
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,660
You bastard. How dare you...

486
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,920
How dare you? How dare you?

487
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,670
- Mr. Lee Hyeon Oh!
- You bastard.

488
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,000
What are you doing right now?

489
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,810
- Let go!
- Sit down!

490
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,470
You cheeky bastard.

491
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,940
What year did you graduate from the institute? Huh?

492
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,120
You're neither the minister nor my senior.

493
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,260
You're being investigated as a suspect now.

494

What are you doing right now?

495
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,490
Sit down.

496
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,560
Sit down!

497
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:34,680
Father, you should've done a better job of cleaning up.

498
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,310
Do you think you won?

499
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,520
Nothing can prove that I did that.

500
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,160
The public will start losing interest, too.

501
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,390
I'll be cleared of charges due to lack of evidence soon.

502
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,700
You killed someone.

503
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,990
Because you didn't want to lose what you had.

504
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,840
Lee Seon Ho thought that was possible because you kept covering things up for him.

505
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,070
So?

506
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,870
I've been living with the guilt that I killed my parents my whole life.

507
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,950
And the family of the man you killed that day

508
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,860
has been waiting for 20 years

509

What's the point of all this?

522
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,690
Although Lee Seon Ho is blaming Lee Hyeon Oh,

523
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:53,050
Lee Hyeon Oh will only be punished for abuse of power and concealing of evidence.

524
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,140
He'd serve five years at most.

525
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,230
But if he keeps denying and covering things up using his authority,

526
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,730
he might be on probation.

Lee Hyeon Oh won't get out of it this time.

01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,740
What's going on?

820
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,820
What's wrong?

821
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,750
The camera...

822
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,980
isn't working.

823
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,760
Why did you come back here?

824
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,300
Na Rae,

825
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,150
I know this sounds weird,

826
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:31,530
but you thought your husband was still here, right?

827
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:36,840
Did something happen?

828
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:45,330
I think I met your husband, Na Rae.

829
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,160
The camera is mine now.

830
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,160
You can't do anything with that.

831
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,150
You don't know how I died.

832
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,730
I'm your opponent.

833
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,600
This is no good.

834
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,340
I have no choice but to send him there.

835
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,420
The camera.

836
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,010
The camera!

837
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,050
The camera!

838
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,940
Mr. Baek.

839
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,580
This really is the end.

840
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,360
Mr. Baek...

841
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,170
Mr. Baek!

842
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,570
Mr. Baek!

01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,280
Mr. Baek.

Mr. Baek.

Mr. Baek!

846
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,950
Mr. Seo.

847
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,740
You know how I died, right?

848
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,320
I...

849
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,560
will stall the evil spirit.

850
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,210
Use this knife...

851
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,880
to kill me.

852
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:54,220
I-I-I can't do it.

853
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,260
Will you kill other people, too?

854
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,790
You'll be destroyed, then!

855
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,030
You can't go to the netherworld...

856
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:04,350
and you'll disappear forever. You know that!

857
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,830
I can't last any longer.

858

Seo Ki Joo!

859
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,190
Hurry up!

860
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,980
Mr. Baek.

861
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,710
Mr. Baek!

862
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:49,690
Why did you do that? Why?

863
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,630
Good work,

864
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,250
Ki Joo.

865
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,010
Good work.

No... no...

867

This is not right! This is not right!

868

This is not right!

Why isn't he answering?

I want to have dinner with him.

Why is this...

that someone else cursed me?

[The Midnight Studio]  💞 @ kissasian.one

I may not be able to go back because the studio's door closed.

888

The one you tried to save desperately will pay their price now.

There's no way!

Am I going to die now?

891
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,680
What's scarier than the path to the netherworld is

892
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,080
living in the world without you alone.

893
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,120
I'll come back for sure.
