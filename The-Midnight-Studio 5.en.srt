00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,090
What's the bad news, then?

357
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,960
This is also the bad news.

358
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,920
It means the subway rush hour and Monday blues are back.

359
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,330
Hey, let me stay here for a while.

360
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,480
I don't have a single penny in my bank account.

361
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,170
Stay permanently, not just for a while.

362
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,250
I have an extra room, too. It's yours.

363
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,260
No, actually, let's sleep together starting tonight.

364
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,750
What's wrong with you?

365
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,020
Just eat the fried chicken.

366
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,370
Seriously. It's because I'm scared.

367
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,230
What? Mom wants to meet Dad?

368
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,310
Do you know what that man did to us?

369
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,870
He gambled and cheated.

370
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,500
My mom died out of anger!

371
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,550
How could you say she wants to see him? Crazy bastard!

372
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,860
How does that make sense? How?

373
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,720
That's what I had told her, too,

374
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,900
but the visitor said she still loves her husband.

375
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,090
- You crazy bastard. Are you serious? Crazy bastard!
- Stop!

376
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,530
- What are you?
- Stop him.

377
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,260
How dare you show up here? Who do you think you are?

378
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,170
[Safe Zone]
- Huh? You-
- Calm down.

379
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,970
What's so great about a husband who cheated and left?

380
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,180
It'd take a while to persuade them.

381
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,390
What took you so long?

382
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,820
Pardon?

383
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,030
Should you be angry about me coming home late?

384
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,600
Of course. You don't pick up your phone.

385
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Well...

386
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
[Missed Calls]

387
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,170
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

388
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,250
Did something happen?

389
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,630
Are you serious right now? The ghosts were-

390
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,960
Did you come to my place when I was sick, by chance?

391
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,020
Ji Won said you stopped by.

392
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,220
Grandma.

393
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,540
Don't go.

394
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,860
Don't leave me.

395
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,190
Grandma.

396
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,400
Because of the ledgers.

397
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
There were more ledgers. I wanted to put them back.

398
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,050
Oh, the ledgers.

399
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Well, I'm sorry.

400
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,900
About what?

401
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,700
For letting you see stuff like this.

402
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,010
To be honest, you shouldn't be going through this.

403
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,890
I'm looking for a solution. Please wait a bit.

404
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Well, I think I was born to see ghosts.

405
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,250
I've always liked thriller, horror, and zombie movies.

406
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,320
I'm okay, so take your time finding a solution.

407
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,500
I'll do it.

408
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,400
Good work.

409
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,410
Hold on.

410
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,600
What... What are you doing right now?

411
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm giving you a compliment.

412
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,040
You worked hard today, too, Mr. Seo.

413
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,030
I'm sure no one told you that since no one knew what you go through.

414
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,330
I've been thinking.

415
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,600
I wondered why I provide the safe zone and why I suddenly see ghosts.

416
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,060
But I guess it was to recognize you.

417
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,130
That there's sweet Seo Ki Joo who helps other people without

418
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,500
being able to tell anyone how much he struggles.

419
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,770
I was brought here to compliment you.

420
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,390
I'll compliment you now.

421
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,750
Oh, wait...

422
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,080
I need to work.

423
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,820
See you tomorrow, Mr. Seo.

424
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,990
Oh, right. Make sure you answer your phone.

425
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,400
Move!

426
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,740
Leave. Leave.

427
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,390
Leave!

428
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,680
I'll kill you if you cross this line.

429
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,660
I'll kill you.

430
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,220
Stay in this circle. Stay close to me.

431
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,380
I'll protect you.

432
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,700
Don't you know you're a ghost, too?

433
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,300
I'm not a ghost.

434
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,110
Well done, Seo Ki Joo.

435
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,970
You did great.

436
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,500
Put your hand away. Right now.

437
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,560
Aren't you going to?

438
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,760
Hello, I'll be joining the marketing team today. I'm Kim Ji-

439
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,320
That's enough.

440
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,380
I hate it when they say, "I'll work hard. I'll do my best."

441
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,890
Don't ask me again if I taught you once.

442
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,010
Don't make plans in the evenings or on weekends.

443
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,220
Don't keep your phone off.

444
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,190
Your desk is...

445
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,930
Intern Park's old desk over there.

446
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,800
Finish the product sales trend report for the first half of the year,

447
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,900
competitors' product trends, road map proposal this week

448
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,570
and put it on my desk by next Monday morning.

449
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,420
Until when? Next Monday morning.

450
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,040
Where?

451
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,200
My desk right here.

452
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,470
You said you have experience. You can do it, right?

453
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,340
Yes, of course.

454
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,550
Hold on. Don't smile for no reason.

455
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,400
Nice to meet you.

456
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,890
Is this a party? Are you happy?

457
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,790
Today is Thursday. How can she finish all that by Monday?

458
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,410
He's telling her to leave instead of half-assing it.

459
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,060
I bet 30,000 won that she'll last two months.

460
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,740
She looked gutsy, though.

461
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,460
I bet 30,000 won that she'll last three months.

462
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,210
Chief Kim wasn't always responsible for people quitting.

463
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,600
Remember the ghost who died from overworking three years ago?

464
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,030
He hasn't left the office since he resents not being promoted as the deputy.

465
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,540
Intern Park left after seeing the ghost, too.

466
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,420
I bet 50,000 won that she'll last a month.

467
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,210
The keyboard noise.

468
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm sensitive to it.

469
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,700
I bet my memorial service food that she'll last 15 days.

470
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,530
Who are you, by the way?

471
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,750
Who else?

472
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,020
I'm behind you, you bastard.

473
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,550
Did that book open by itself just now?

474
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:05,790
Since when were there books?

475
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,500
Great. Marketing ace Kim Ji Won.

476
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,550
Let me prove my skills.

477
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,950
No.

478
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,880
A week will be more than enough for this girl.

479
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,430
I'm back, Na Rae.

480
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,200
I'm sorry I'm late today.

481
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,550
I was supposed to be back in the morning, but something happened in the studio.

482
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,260
Did I tell you about the safe zone?

483
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,840
There's a woman with a very strange power.

484
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,200
She doesn't only provide a safe zone,

485
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,800
she can also see ghosts now.

486
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,960
It's so crazy that a human can see ghosts.

487
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,560
I looked at her directly in her eyes.

488
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,540
She made eye contact with me directly-

489
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,600
Be careful. It could've been dangerous.

490
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,930
You could've gotten hurt.

491
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,940
I wish you could...

492
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
see me like that woman.

493
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,110
Why are you still wearing this?

494
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,540
You should forget about the dead quickly.

495
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,110
Patrol No. 12. Patrol No. 12.

496
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,210
A man who appears to be Park Doo Chil was seen around the wharf on the Incheon coast.

497
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,080
Please check.

498
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,230
Why is this here?

499
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,970
Patrol No. 12. Patrol No. 12.

500
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:55,010
A man who appears to be Park Doo Chil was seen around the wharf on the Incheon coast.

501
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,250
Please check. Patrol No. 12. Patrol No. 12.

502
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,450
I need to go.

503
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,640
I'll be back, Na Rae.

504
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,810
The report sounds credible this time.

505
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:20,050
He won't leave Seoul so easily. Doo Chil.

506
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,470
You bastard.

507
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,820
I give! I give! Give up!

508
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,810
Go in.

509
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,250
Hey.

510
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,270
I caught him, okay?

511
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,310
What are you, a thug? Why do you even play sports?

512
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,970
I just missed a few classes, but I'm better than you.

513
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,680
You're a brown belt. Don't challenge a black belt.

514
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,800
Do you want to do sparring?

515
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,410
- What are you doing?
- What... What did I do?

516
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,920
Wait for me!

517
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,250
Hey, wait for me, you bastard.

518
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,200
They say you can't leave this world if you have regrets.

519
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,250
Are you doing that, too, Nam Goo?

520
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,700
I got us some snacks.

521
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,010
Hey, isn't that Park Doo Chil?

522
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,400
- Shit!
- Hey! Stop right there!

523
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,620
Hey! Stop right there!

524
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,070
Stop right there!

525
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,860
Stop there, you bastard!

526
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,450
That there's sweet Seo Ki Joo who helps other people without

527
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,700
being able to tell anyone how much he struggles.

528
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,360
I was brought here to compliment you.

529
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,090
I'll compliment you now.

530
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,040
What am I, a kid?

531
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,390
She's the one who should be comforted now.

532
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,230
Mr. Seo!

533

Mr. Seo, I found it. A way to bring Bom back to normal.

534

I'm so tired from reading this all night.

535
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,570
My eyes are tired, too. My eyesight is already bad.

536
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,440
I know that you've been out.

537
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,840
You still harass poor young people, right?

538

Well, I...

539
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,000
Anyway, my diligent research revealed that

540
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,910
there have been two cases where they saw ghosts.

541
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,120
They were both children. Hold on.

"A ferocious 12-year-old girl cried every night, saying she sees ghosts.

547

This is my log.

00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,650
The first visitor. Right?

550
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,150
You know, the only ghost who kept the gate of the dead open after three days.

551
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,590
What happened to that child?

552
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,070
I'm sure he left.

553

He's not here right now.

"A child who took a photo with a visitor came by through the gate of the dead.

557

The child was weak and pale from being harassed by the ghosts.

558
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,760
The mother was very worried about the child.

559

Why did she doodle here, too?

564
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:25,860
Anyway, it seems like she will return to normal if she takes a photo with another dead.

565
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,730
The problem is...

566
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:36,690
The problem is that no one would use that precious opportunity to take a photo with her.

567
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Maybe I should've said I'm not okay.

Right. This is the wrong way.

00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:08,510
You don't have to provide me a safe zone anymore.

710
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,520
But you said you needed it.

711
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:18,170
You said you were afraid to protect someone then, right?

712
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,070
I'm scared, too.

713
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:28,150
Since I moved into this house, strange things started happening to you.

714
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:32,760
First, you opened the door, you created a circle,

715
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,620
and you started seeing ghosts.

716
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,890
I thought you were strange and an exception,

717
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,410
but to you, I'm an exception and a strange person.

718
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,700
I'm not sure how well someone like me could protect you.

719
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,100
I saved you in front of the house this time,

720
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,850
but there's no guarantee that'd happen again.

721
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,310
I'll move out.

Let's keep a distance and try not to get involved if we can.

725

You need to keep living as an honest and kind citizen.

So tell me what I'm supposed to do.

740

Who's saving whom?

743
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,990
That was the right thing to do, right?

744
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,490
If you can't send the dead away in three days,

745
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,670
you can forcefully open the gate of the dead and send the visitor to the netherworld.

746
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,600
But the one who opened the gate of the dead

747
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,200
might face death for getting involved in the matter of life and death.

748
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,520
So, one always needs to be careful when opening the gate of the dead.
