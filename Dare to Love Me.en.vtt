there's the celebrity who makes the designer shine.

I had to bribe the shop manager so much to get it.

She agreed to give it to me since I spent tens of millions and insisted.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.020
That means she doesn't want to.

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:42.380
The kid from the Seongsan Village. Isn't he kind of weird?

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.340
- Why would he wear the gat* with the school uniform?
- I know.
(Traditional hat for men)

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.760
It got in the way during a class, so I told him to take it off.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.970
And he said, "This is my last duty as a scholar."

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.790
I completely lost it.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.790
Gosh, young master!

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.170
What brings you to this humble place?

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.670
This bag... Should I call it a bojjim?

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:04.410
Let me carry that for you.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.060
I deserve to die, young master!

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.380
Cut his head off immediately!

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.130
I was nothing but a laughing stock for being different

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.480
and it made me feel small.

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.980
That was when this one person showed up.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.440
Here.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.270
Shin Yoon Bok?

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:46.520
Is your name Shin Yoon Bok?

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.890
Yes.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.730
Hello, I'm Kim Hong Do.

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:58.050
She was the first teacher who approached me without any prejudice.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:00.390
It was Ms. Kim Hong Do.

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:06.870
Young Master, we were told to draw a family member.

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.580
Why draw a 1,000-won bill?

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.520
Is this old man your family, by chance?

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.750
How cool.

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.690
Your grandfather looks very distinguished.

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:27.240
Yoon Bok, you don't have to be embarrassed for being different.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.420
Whether people like it or not,

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.390
you're plenty cool as you are.

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:33.900
Right?

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.050
Let me see.

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:39.340
You did a great job.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.420
Yes, it has been a long time.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.010
But what brings you here, Yoon Bok?

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:51.880
I asked a friend, and he said you would be here.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:57.290
And I wanted to give you these flowers.

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:00.930
It is my gratitude as your student. Please take it.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.540
Gosh, seriously.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.720
I quit the academy so long ago.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.930
I should have given you flowers every year.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.940
But I am finally giving it to you now. I apologize.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.790
Thank you.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:21.790
Not at all. It is my duty as your student.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:24.330
Thank you so much.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:28.890
It's been so long since I was gifted flowers.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.950
Oh, my. Silly me.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.970
Have a seat. Have a seat. Let's sit and talk.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.270
Are you okay?

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.810
Are you okay?

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:11.480
Take it off.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.010
Take it off!

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.290
Take it off!

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:16.570
Teacher, you cannot do this.

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:19.060
Take it off, I said.

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.990
Was it you?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.380
[We thank Im Ho and Jeong Yi Rang for the special appearance]

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:02.930
[Dare to Love Me]

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:07.140
[Epilogue]

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.940
Please calm down.

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.990
This is a tricky situation.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.160
What can I do to stop your tears?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.470
Tell me anything.

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:46.290
What can I do to stop your tears?

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.950
I don't know.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.320
Buy me flowers or something.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.040
Flowers?

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:08.430
Did you sleep well, Teacher?

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.760
What are you doing there, Yoon Bok?

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.540
Why is the teacher avoiding me like that?

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.920
I saw suspicious people entering the VIP room.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.800
What? Take you where?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.870
Why is the path of becoming a Jookdori so difficult?

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.280
Sunbaenim, did you design this yourself, by chance?

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.620
Are you asking me if I copied your design?

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:29.460
- Just quit your job.
- You quit if you feel uncomfortable at work.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.600
I said leave, Kim Hong Do!

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.470
How dare you touch her?

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:40.010
