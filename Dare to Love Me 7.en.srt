Whenever I struggled and felt small

00:16:46.681 --> 00:16:52.737
Why are you so kind to me, Teacher?

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.367
What?

00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:58.087
Come on, I didn't do anything.

00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:02.387
It's my job as your teacher. I should've cared for you sooner.

00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:04.657
I've been so negligent.

00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:08.847

Yes.

I'll get changed and be there right away.

00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:49.351

00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:30.601
Why are you suddenly avoiding me?

00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:33.507
You said you wanted to be close to me.

00:19:33.531 --> 00:19:35.997
Whether it's a salty or sweet day,

00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:38.277
you said you'd always cheer me on.

00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:42.197
Why are you suddenly telling me not to approach you?

00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:44.201
I apologize.

00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:48.577
Is it because of that letter, by chance?

00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:51.357
- Pardon?
- I didn't write that.

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:54.931
Hong Hak wrote it, but it got switched somehow.

00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:58.097
It is not because of the letter.

00:19:58.121 --> 00:20:00.687
What? What is it, then?

00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:02.971
Why are you like this, then?

00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:06.567
The thing is

00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:10.587
If so, will you leave for Paris

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:13.517
after the show?

00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:18.801
Of course, I have to go if she'd take me.

00:20:22.191 --> 00:20:26.297
I'm really disappointed, Yoon Bok.

00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:33.327
I thought you'd be happier for me more than anyone else that day.

00:20:33.351 --> 00:20:36.747
I got to join Camille, thanks to you.

00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:42.307
So, I wanted to thank you, celebrate together, and be congratulated.

00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:44.487
But you suddenly pushed me away.

00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:47.077
It hurts, and I don't know why.

00:20:47.101 --> 00:20:50.561
Why are you doing this?

00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.121
Did you

00:20:57.721 --> 00:21:00.461
feel that upset?

00:21:04.011 --> 00:21:07.881
Nothing in the world lasts forever.

00:21:09.721 --> 00:21:11.851

Eight.

00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:17.387
A student in a school uniform and gat is here.

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.847
- Please tell him there's no such person.
- Where are you going?

00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:25.997
The heart that was expected to never change changed easily, too.

00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:27.621
However

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:32.861
my fear ended up hurting Teacher.

00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:35.721
How disloyal of me.

00:21:37.711 --> 00:21:40.091
It is my fault.

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.427
- What?
- I was absorbed into my emotions

00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:48.517
that I did not think you would feel upset.

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:53.397
So, I would like to apologize formally.

00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:56.551
- What?
- Please wait a moment.

00:21:57.171 --> 00:21:59.261
Wait

- Again?
- "Teachers are endlessly generous."

00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:23.101
Teachers are endlessly generous. One cannot even step on their shadows.

00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:27.301
This foolish student dared to hurt your feelings.

00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:31.025
Nothing can possibly make you forgive me, but

00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:35.525
My gosh. Are you crying?

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:42.025
Please forgive this inadequate pupil!

00:22:45.475 --> 00:22:47.995
You'd better get up now.

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.675
I did not expect to be forgiven easily.

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:10.931
They say foolish students learn by being disciplined by their teachers.

00:23:10.955 --> 00:23:12.441
What's this?

00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:14.441
My heart is heavy.

Why would I hit you?

00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:26.495
Do you want to apologize that badly?

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:32.341
- Yes.
- Can you do it differently, then?

00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:34.271
Please ask anything.

00:23:34.295 --> 00:23:36.131

- Wishes?
- I have three.

You have three wishes?

00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:50.711
Why not? You play rock, paper, scissors three times

00:23:50.735 --> 00:23:53.611
and eat three times a day, too.

00:23:53.635 --> 00:23:55.441
What? You don't want to?

00:23:55.465 --> 00:23:57.811
Well, it is not that.

00:23:57.835 --> 00:24:00.981
I will grant your three wishes.

00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:03.451
- Go ahead and tell me.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:06.305
Hold on. Well

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.975
My first wish is

00:24:17.075 --> 00:24:20.601
What did you say just now?

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.031
It's exactly as I said.

00:24:22.055 --> 00:24:25.781
Treat me rudely from now on.

00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:28.245
How could I dare to treat you rudely?

00:24:29.875 --> 00:24:31.191
- I cannot even speak about it.
- Yes, yes.

00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:34.001
What you said just now. Don't say things like that.

00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:37.851

sit in front of me, and we'll share a table, too.

That's all you need to do.

00:24:57.305 --> 00:24:59.165

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:02.331

Yes. They are both at the right age,

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:01.361
- Hello.
- Aigoo.

00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:03.621
You are the Young Master's teacher.

00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:05.721
I am happy to see you in Seoul.

00:32:05.745 --> 00:32:09.585
Me, too. By the way, what brings you here?

00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.141
Is Ms. Ca inside?

00:32:12.165 --> 00:32:13.711
Ms. Ca?

00:32:13.735 --> 00:32:17.345
Oh, yes, yes. Come on in.

00:32:21.745 --> 00:32:23.291
Good to see you, Madam Yeoju.

00:32:23.315 --> 00:32:26.971
I've been eager to hear from Seongsan Village.

00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:30.085
So, what did the old man say?

00:32:31.205 --> 00:32:35.601
Master said he would allow the fashion show.

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:38.071
Bravo!

00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:41.041
But under one condition.

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:42.485
Condition?

00:32:43.355 --> 00:32:47.141
I wish I could allow it unconditionally,

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:53.811
but I cannot make such a major decision alone without the villagers' agreement.

00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:58.931
The people here are suspicious of events they are unfamiliar with.

00:32:58.955 --> 00:33:02.621
So, come in person and try to persuade them.

00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:06.321
If more than half of the village is open to the idea,

00:33:06.345 --> 00:33:09.235
the deal will go through.

00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:16.501
To have the fashion show, come to the village and persuade the villagers?

00:33:16.525 --> 00:33:18.325
Just one moment.

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:25.951
A key?

00:33:25.975 --> 00:33:29.695
I prepared a place for you to stay in the village.

00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:41.241
Is she shooting a period drama?

00:33:41.265 --> 00:33:42.761
Look at her hair. She's the real deal.

00:33:42.785 --> 00:33:44.991
It's so funny.

00:33:45.015 --> 00:33:47.385
What's she doing here?

00:33:48.465 --> 00:33:49.971
Daebak.

00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:53.161
Why are you spacing out like that?

00:33:53.185 --> 00:33:55.921
Are you sleeping with your eyes open?

00:33:55.945 --> 00:34:00.125
I was going to make a bed and lie down here if you came a bit later.

00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.161
Let us go.

00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:06.451
Before we go, let's stop by somewhere.

00:34:06.475 --> 00:34:08.201
We still have some time for the bus.

00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:09.831
Where are we stopping by?

00:34:09.855 --> 00:34:13.165
I need to make dinner for Master.

00:34:15.535 --> 00:34:18.885
It is my fault for not knowing how to get around in Seoul.

00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:21.675
I suppose I will follow him.

00:34:26.305 --> 00:34:28.771
I brought the stuff you'd need.

00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:30.411
Are you really sure about this?

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:32.825
Would it be colder than Seoul there?

00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:36.975
I need to care for myself there, too, right?

00:34:37.035 --> 00:34:38.565
All right

00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:43.761
Hold on. What if I get bored?

00:34:43.785 --> 00:34:47.701
That's what I'm saying. You don't have the internet there, either.

00:34:47.725 --> 00:34:49.911
What? No internet?

00:34:49.935 --> 00:34:51.755
Yes.

00:34:53.415 --> 00:34:55.461
I'll need to pick up some books on the way.

00:34:55.485 --> 00:34:58.735
You know I hate being bored.

00:35:00.715 --> 00:35:02.101
How will you cook there?

00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:04.471
You probably can't get food delivered from outside.

00:35:04.495 --> 00:35:09.211
Food? I almost forgot about food.

00:35:09.235 --> 00:35:12.071
You know the instant rice? The stuff you put in the microwave.

00:35:12.095 --> 00:35:14.365
I need to pick up some of that.

00:35:15.395 --> 00:35:18.211
Do they even have a microwave?

00:35:18.235 --> 00:35:20.355
Do I need to bring that, too?

00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:24.901
Are you worried I won't adjust?

00:35:24.925 --> 00:35:27.461
How could I not worry, then?

00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:29.631
I'm Camille.

00:35:29.655 --> 00:35:33.485
If I can't adjust, I'll make them adjust to me.

The hanbok makes you stand out too much.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:11.115
Everyone was looking at you when you were walking in Gangnam.

00:36:12.355 --> 00:36:14.135
That's just what I thought.

00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:17.931
Seriously, why

00:36:17.955 --> 00:36:19.615
Try it on.

00:36:54.035 --> 00:36:55.251
What do you think?

00:36:55.275 --> 00:36:59.095
Do you not notice me as much with this on?

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:04.231
You said I was all you could see.

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:08.455
Maybe you're more noticeable now.

00:37:10.765 --> 00:37:12.885
I'll take those.

This is called tonkatsu.

It's what sophisticated people in Seoul eat.

What does

00:52:15.463 --> 00:52:17.599
my Yoon Bok like?

00:52:17.623 --> 00:52:19.523
Yoon Bok?

00:52:23.653 --> 00:52:25.373
He likes webtoons.

00:52:26.163 --> 00:52:28.343
- Webtoons?
- Yes.

00:52:29.163 --> 00:52:33.649
I first met him when I was a teacher at a webtoon academy.

00:52:33.673 --> 00:52:37.169
A high schooler showed up wearing a gat and

00:52:37.193 --> 00:52:39.609
so solemnly said

00:52:39.633 --> 00:52:42.633
"I am here to ask you to teach me."

00:52:44.613 --> 00:52:46.859
He looked so cool when he said that.

00:52:46.883 --> 00:52:49.119
All the kids were freaking out.

00:52:49.143 --> 00:52:52.669
And then I reunited with him after seven years.

00:52:52.693 --> 00:52:56.049
He said, "I never stopped being grateful for you," and

00:52:56.073 --> 00:52:59.369
gave me seven carnations.

00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:02.213
My heart skipped a beat then.

00:53:22.973 --> 00:53:26.023
I didn't know your mother was so ill.

00:53:27.193 --> 00:53:30.723
Thank you so much for coming with me.

00:53:31.653 --> 00:53:36.113
I was so scared when I got the call from the hospital earlier.

00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:41.503
If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have even come to the hospital.

00:53:43.813 --> 00:53:46.283
Did you contact Yoon Bok?

00:53:48.413 --> 00:53:51.339
Doesn't he know she's sick?

00:53:51.363 --> 00:53:55.099
I did tell him, but

00:53:55.123 --> 00:53:57.773
I guess he's still angry.

00:53:59.673 --> 00:54:04.353
I hope she hangs in there until he stops being angry.

00:54:05.553 --> 00:54:07.913
She misses him a lot.

00:54:11.493 --> 00:54:13.389
Don't worry.

00:54:13.413 --> 00:54:15.713
She'll hang in there.

00:54:23.173 --> 00:54:24.679
I'm not sure.

00:54:24.703 --> 00:54:29.229
Oh, the cargo was unlocked when I arrived,

00:54:29.253 --> 00:54:32.439
but I assumed I didn't lock it properly.

00:54:32.463 --> 00:54:35.053
