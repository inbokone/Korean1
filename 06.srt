1
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,630
Who's there?!

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
How dare you break into this house.

3
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,670
Do you know whose house this is?

4
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,759
Where's the key?

5
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
Under the tree pot.

6
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,229
Hands above your head.

7
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,479
And slowly turn around.

8
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,360
Hey, where are you going?!

9
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,190
Shit, this is all I got?

10
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
Not worth it at all.

11
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,590
Good thing no one caught me.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
I don't think...

13
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Sol saw my face.

14
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,630
Mom.

15
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,960
Joe, is that you, Joe?

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,150
Mom, I'm sorry.

17
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Did I wake you up?

18
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,190
Joe, Joe...I'm hurt.

19
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,710
Mom, Mom, Mom!

20
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,510
Mom, Mom, Mom!

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,590
Mom! Mom!

22
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,030
Mom! Mom!

23
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Mom! Mom!

24
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,190
Joe, how's your Mom?

25
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,070
Joe.

26
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,230
So, what happened?

27
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,320
The doctor said she had a Pulmonary edema.

28
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,360
That's why it's hard for her to breathe.

29
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
But she's getting better now.

30
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,590
Pulmonary edema?

31
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,030
And how did it happen?

32
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,510
The doctor still needs a few days for thorough diagnosis

33
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,070
before we know what caused it.

34
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Right now, we could only assume that it's something about her kidney.

35
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,550
I have a relative who has a problem with a kidney, also.

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,590
But what I wanna tell you is...

37
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,360
the medical equipments now have been improved.

38
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,360
Trust me, your Mom is going to be okay.

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,480
She'll be fine.

40
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,550
Thanks.

41
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,440
These past two years...

42
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,150
she had been working very hard for me.

43
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,550
And when I woke up and now she's like this,â€¦

44
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,840
was it worth it?

45
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,030
Joe, listen...

46
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,840
No mothers in this world want their kid to die.

47
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,590
If you want to blame something,

48
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,030
blame the old karma.

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Don't blame yourself.

50
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,760
Believe me.

51
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,440
When are you two gonna get passed all this terrible mess?

52
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Don't overthink.

53
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Hang on.

54
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
What's up?

55
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Ming, again?

56
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,760
Okay, I'll hurry. Wait for me, okay?

57
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,110
What's wrong?

58
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,190
There's someone in my team is having a problem with Ming.

59
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
Excuse me, I need to clear this up. / Alright.

60
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
And today, you don't have to go to the office. Take care of your Mom.

61
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,630
Thank you. / See ya!

62
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,630
See you, see you.

63
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,800
This is for Joe's sake.

64
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,840
Since he repented

65
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,840
and moved to Korea, so I left him alone.

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,110
And what's this?

67
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,400
He's back and he's breaking into my house.

68
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
Watch your words.

69
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,110
The reason I went to Korea wasn't because I was afraid of you.

70
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,190
But I'd have missed Joe if I'd stayed.

71
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,230
And the important thing is...that is Joe's house.

72
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,230
Not yours.

73
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,280
It's our house.

74
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,590
Joe will be back.

75
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,590
Accept the truth.

76
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,510
You're trying to redeem yourself because you're the cause of his death.

77
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,360
He's not dead yet!

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
Hey, hey, hey, calm, calm, calm.

79
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
Ming, no.

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Calm down. No!

81
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,590
Sol.

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,360
Just a thief breaking into Joe's house is bad enough.

83
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Why would you two fight?

84
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,190
A thief? There's no thief, only your beloved bro here...

85
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,510
sneaking into my house and making things up.

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,670
I guess he missed Joe so much that he couldn't help it.

87
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,000
And why would I do that?

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,030
Sol.

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,510
And why did you go there?

90
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,440
When I got back to Thailand,

91
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,110
I missed him...

92
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
So I came over...

93
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,230
You sneaked in and got scared so you made this up.

94
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,600
See, Wut? I told you that we should clear all this on our own.

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
No need to tell him.

96
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,600
C'mon.

97
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,760
No matter what, Ming is the one who lives there now.

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,640
But...is there anything missing?

99
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Little cash and some membership cards.

100
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,350
Maybe that thief wanted to steal credit cards or ATM cards?

101
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,960
But without a passcode,

102
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,470
he wouldn't be able to get the cash out. That's weird.

103
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I think he's trying to get other valuable things.

104
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,920
But he saw me first.

105
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,150
Well, about this...

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,030
We need a professional to manage.

107
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,070
If this gets to the police,

108
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,150
the press will definitely get it.

109
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,720
And both of your names will be shown.
Things will even get out of hand.

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,920
My family knows a good and trustworthy private detector.

111
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,110
Good. Then, I'll leave it to you.

112
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,800
And you, give all the information as much as needed.

113
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,720
Check the CCTVs from every alley around the area.

114
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,840
I think some of the CCTVs must capture the thief.

115
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm on it.

116
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,600
How are you doing, Mom?

117
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm okay. So what is it, darling?

118
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Well, we gotta wait for the diagnosis for a few days first.

119
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,840
If...if it's something really bad...

120
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,030
Mom!

121
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,110
Don't say that, Mom.

122
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,560
It might be just the lack of sleep.

123
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
I hope so.

124
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,680
And why do I have to stay here?

125
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
I actually can go home.

126
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,960
Mom, it's better for you to stay here.

127
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
You can take a rest, and people can come take care of you.

128
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
I can support you, Mom.

129
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,430
So don't you think about it.

130
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,390
You have to take lots of rest so you can recover soon.

131
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Thanks, darling.

132
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Excuse me.

133
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm here to ask about the initial payment of my Mom's bill.

134
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh, the initial payment includes the admission.

135
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,960
The X-ray, the doctor's treatment, dialysis and filtration.

136
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,720
The initial payment?

137
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes, this is the initial payment.

138
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
You have to consult with the doctor first.

139
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,880
So we can conclude the medical bills.

140
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,230
Thank you.

141
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,150
Hello.

142
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,230
Hello, Joy.

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Yes, who's this?

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
It's Joe.

145
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,920
Wut's stuntman.

146
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Well, I'm interested in the tryout to be Tong's stand-in.

147
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,800
Er, I'm sorry, Joe.

148
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Tong has already got his stand-in.

149
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,430
Alright.

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Cut.

151
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,520
Okay, I'm really okay with this, Tong.

152
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,310
This won't do.

153
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,880
From the back, you can see that it's not even close.

154
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,310
But this is the closest stand-in that we could find.

155
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,430
The closest isn't still enough.

156
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
And the one that's identical is not here anymore.

157
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,150
Joy.

158
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,110
Oh, Joe.

159
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,190
Who's that?

160
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
The stuntman whom I told you about.

161
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,840
The one I wanted to cast as your stand-in.

162
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Interesting.

163
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,190
Hey, you wanna finish this scene first?

164
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,150
Then, you go change first,

165
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,640
and play this scene for me.

166
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Thank you.

167
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Man, did he hear what I said?

168
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,880
I've never thought that in this life I gotta be his stand-in again.

169
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,350
Tong.

170
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
We've shot so many scenes.

171
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,230
If we're gonna change the stand-in right now, I think...

172
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,150
I'm the owner of this project.

173
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
If he can do it,

174
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,190
I'll do the reshoot.

175
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
Alright, up to you.

176
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,720
Ah, hey, ready to shoot. C'mon.

177
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Everyone, are you ready? Ready?

178
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
The cast, are you ready?

179
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,880
Ready, and...

180
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,310
action!

181
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,350
Cut!

182
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I think he's not so different from the other guy.

183
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,350
They're all the same.

184
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,350
Who told you that?

185
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,470
From behind, he looks exactly like Tong.

186
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,030
Ming, when did you get here?

187
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,070
If I were you, I would choose him as my stand-in without question.

188
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,310
If that's what my biggest fan said...

189
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,470
I would have to agree with that.

190
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,030
Here. This is the contract. / Yes.

191
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,270
Keep this.

192
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,310
We'll have a lunch break and then we'll continue in the afternoon.

193
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,150
I'm happy for you.

194
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,190
Thank you, Joy.

195
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'll do my best.

196
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,150
Thanks.

197
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,190
Excuse me.

198
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,230
Where are you going?

199
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Stay.

200
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
How did you cast for Tong's stand-in?

201
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,030
Well, I used to play series for him.

202
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,350
So Joy asked me.

203
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
And who taught you all the moves?

204
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,430
I like watching Tong's movies.

205
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,470
So I remembered his moves.

206
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,030
Hey, Ming.

207
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,230
You know each other?

208
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I used to shoot an ad with Mr. Ming.

209
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,560
Oh.

210
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Tong.

211
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,430
I want to play in this movie.
Is it possible to write a role for me?

212
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,680
Really?

213
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,720
At first, I invited you, and you didn't even think about it.

214
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,760
I saw that scene earlier and I think it's interesting.

215
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,349
Of course, I'll have the screenwriter write a role for you.

216
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,109
And if this project...

217
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
has you in it, it will be so famous.

218
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,390
Hello. Hello.

219
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Hello.

220
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,470
I'll leave this to you.

221
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Don't let this get to the police.

222
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,840
If what Sol said was true,

223
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,270
that means the thief must be in a hurry.

224
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,680
And he didn't destroy any evidence.

225
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,560
Shit, I forgot.

226
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,030
I haven't moved anything.

227
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,960
Okay, tonight, I'll be there.

228
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,270
And tomorrow, you come to check again.

229
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,470
Huh? Tonight?

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,230
I can't let Ming go back to my house tonight.

231
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
What should I do?

232
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,270
What are you doing?

233
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,350
Er...well...

234
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,840
Well...

235
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,390
Oh, a crew asked me to ask Mr. Ming to a party.

236
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,030
A crew?

237
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,070
Which one? Why didn't I know about this?

238
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,190
Er...

239
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,110
Mr. Ming, we have something to do tonight.

240
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,150
It's alright.

241
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,070
They asked me to go. How could I say no?

242
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,880
Then, why don't we all go?

243
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,030
It's on me.

244
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,560
Yes, we all should go!

245
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,390
Cheers!

246
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,030
Mr. Ming.

247
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,800
Would you like to sit here? I'll arrange it for you.

248
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,920
Hey, Ming, come here. I've saved you a seat.

249
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,150
Excuse me.

250
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,350
Would you like me to make you a drink?

251
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,150
It's alright. I'll have the waiter make it for me.

252
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,350
You can go sit with the crew.

253
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,430
I'm an extra who was in the scene with you today.

254
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,030
Would you like something?
I'll make a drink for you.

255
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
It's alright. I don't want to drink tonight.

256
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,270
You don't like a crowded place, right?

257
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,270
Me too.

258
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,720
How about we find a quiet place to talk?

259
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
It's alright.

260
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,720
C'mon, just for fun.

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
It's alright. I think...

262
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Come here.

263
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,800
Excuse me.

264
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,680
Ming, why did you bring him here?

265
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,960
Mr. Ming would like me to entertain you guys.

266
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,430
Please, let me make your drinks.

267
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
This is mine.

268
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,430
Here, Mr. Ming.

269
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Mr. Ming doesn't drink.

270
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,310
Thanks.

271
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,600
Just a bit.

272
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Oh.

273
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,470
This is my job.

274
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,150
C'mon, let's clink the glasses.

275
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,920
One. Two. Three.

276
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,600
Ah, c'mon, c'mon.

277
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Cheers!

278
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,760
Oh, you've drunk all of that, c'mon.

279
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,600
Let me pour it for you.

280
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,270
Cheers! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

281
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,030
Wow.

282
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,470
C'mon, let this be the night!

283
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Do you want anything else?

284
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,470
Oh, Mr. Ming. Let me pour more for you.

285
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,390
Bottoms up!

286
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,150
Mr. Ming, cheers!

287
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Bottoms up!

288
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,350
C'mon, one more.

289
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,190
Cheers!

290
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,600
You're not drinking anymore.

291
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
No.

292
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,030
Are you going home now? /I'm gonna get going now.

293
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,030
Oh, okay.

294
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,470
I'll call my wife to pick me up.

295
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,720
Goodbye, Joy, goodbye.

296
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,350
Yes.

297
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,350
Safe travels.

298
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,190
This is still a fun night!

299
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,350
Ming, are you okay?

300
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,190
I'm okay.

301
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,110
Are you sure?

302
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,390
Er, yes, babe?

303
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh, I'm still at the party now.

304
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,230
C'mon, let me pour you some more.

305
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Please.

306
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,350
Let's clink the glasses, Mr. Ming.

307
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,880
Haven't I told you...

308
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,190
that Mr. Ming shouldn't be drinking this much?

309
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I just wanted Mr. Ming to relax.

311
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,720
If he's like this, let's take him to his condo.

312
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,720
But I can't carry him alone.

313
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,070
You come here and help me first, and I'll give you a ride home.

314
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Secretary Jim, I have somewhere to go, I gotta...

315
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,430
Stop it right there, this is your responsibility.

316
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Mr. Ming, I'm sorry.

317
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,270
Alright.

318
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
One. Two. Three.

319
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,230
We're almost there, Mr. Ming.

320
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,190
Easy, easy.

321
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,030
Just a bit more, Mr. Ming.

322
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Be careful.

323
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,600
Hey, hey, Mr. Ming!

324
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,350
Are you alright, Mr. Joe?

325
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Mr. Joe!

326
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Mr. Ming!

327
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Mr. Ming!

328
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,270
Joe.

329
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Mr. Ming!

330
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,470
Joe?

331
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,720
Er...Mr. Ming...well...

332
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Joe.

333
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,190
Mr. Ming! Mr. Ming!

334
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
Er, I'm gonna get going now.

335
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Secretary Jim!

336
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,310
Secretary Jim! Hey! Wait!

337
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Secretary Jim!

338
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,150
Joe.

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Mr. Ming!

340
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,190
I miss you.

341
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,030
I miss you so much.

342
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,350
Joe.

343
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,150
The one Ming misses,

344
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,230
no matter which Joe is,

345
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,310
is not you.

346
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,390
Just go back and finish your plan.

347
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,390
Joe.

348
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,270
Joe.

349
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,070
I miss you so much.

350
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,230
Don't be stupid.

351
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Open your eyes.

352
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,640
The only one he loves is Tong.

353
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,230
Are you sure that the last time you came in, it wasn't like this?

354
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,470
I saw with my own eyes that only that shelf was destroyed.

355
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,150
That means the thief must have come in here last night.

356
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,880
He wanted to destroy the evidence to make us confused.

357
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,310
It seems like he knew that we're gonna come here today.

358
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,720
But I still have one more concern.

359
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,680
What is that?

360
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,390
The door has no sign of force entry.

361
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Or maybe the thief had a modern technology tool...

362
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,150
or he might have a spare key.

363
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,110
But in the meantime, I'll check every little corner thoroughly.

364
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,030
If you have any more questions, please call me.

365
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,310
Excuse me.

366
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,600
The only one who knows where the key is...

367
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,270
Is there anything, Mr. Ming?

368
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,030
No.

369
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,760
Can you reach Joe yet?

370
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,390
He didn't answer any of the calls.

371
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,310
I don't know if this was about last night...

372
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,230
What about last night?

373
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Nothing, Mr. Ming.

374
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,270
I'll hurry and reach Joe as soon as possible.

375
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Excuse me, Doctor.

376
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,560
As far as we can see, the patient has no seizure nor cancer.

377
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,920
But the patient has septicemia which was from her kidneys not functioning.

378
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,560
This is an incurable disease.

379
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,520
But it's not deadly.

380
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,640
The patient must have dialysis every week.

381
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,230
And she'll have a normal life.

382
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,680
At our hospital, we have the department for that.

383
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,350
If you'd like her to do it here,

384
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,350
you can notify the staff at the counter.

385
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

386
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Thank you.

387
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,110
Sol, let me ask you this.

388
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,560
Why don't you go back and continue your career in Korea?

389
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,310
The industry here is too small for you.

390
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,350
At first, I thought about coming home just to rest.

391
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,310
But when there was a Joe's situation involved,

392
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,560
I thought about extending my stay.

393
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,030
So I'm finding stuff to do out of boredom.

394
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay, if you'd like to make music here,

395
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,350
I have an actor for you.

396
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,350
I'd like you to have him in your new music video.

397
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,760
The new stunt of yours named Joe?

398
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,680
Okay, he might not look like the old Joe.

399
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,640
But I don't know why...

400
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,150
When I see him, I always think of Joe.

401
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,150
No one is like Joe.

402
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
No one.

403
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,230
Wut, Joe would like to talk to you.

404
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,640
Hey, I have something to talk to him too.

405
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,800
Let him in.

406
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,270
Wut, hello.

407
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,520
Joe, this is Sol. You might have already known him.

408
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,030
Of course, he's famous.

409
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,680
Sol is looking for a cast for his new music video.

410
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,760
So I think you should try the casting for his new video.

411
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,390
Oh, yes.

412
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,520
I don't think so.

413
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,720
Normally, I only use international celebs or the well-knowns.

414
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,720
Well, would you like for him to try first?

415
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,960
Joe, spin, let him see you.

416
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,600
So?

417
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,270
Just like I said?

418
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,030
I'll check if there's something suitable for him.

419
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm not promising.

420
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,679
Thank you.

421
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,800
I have a doctor's appointment. Excuse me.

422
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Okay.

423
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,270
Safe travels, see ya later, Sol.

424
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,800
So, do you have anything to talk to me?

425
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Yes.

426
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,639
Well, my Mom's result is out.

427
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,880
My mom has a kidney failure.

428
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,350
She might have to do the dialysis for the rest of her life.

429
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,719
I get it now. So that's why you...

430
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,389
chose to be Tong's stand-in, right?

431
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,469
Oh, you know already?

432
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,190
Joe, I told you before, right?

433
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,270
If you have something, come to talk to me about it first.

434
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,470
I just didn't want to bother you.

435
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,680
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,800
Hey, it's okay. I'm not bothered.

437
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,680
And right now, I have some savings.

438
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,270
I'll let you borrow it first while you're waiting for your payment.

439
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,350
It's alright, Wut. Thank you very much.

440
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,720
I can't accept that.

441
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,600
Actually, I'm here just to tell you about Tong's movie.

442
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,390
If you have any work that I could do...

443
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,560
Don't worry, don't worry.

444
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,920
I'll try to push you as far as I can to make you be in Sol's new music video.

445
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,560
And in the meantime, if you have any troubles,

446
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,520
you must accept my help, alright?

447
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,150
Thank you so much, Wut.

448
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,310
No need to thank me anymore. Oh, and one more thing...

449
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,000
working with Tong, you must be careful.

450
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,390
Seriously, Tong is an asshole.

451
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,310
You can't trust him.

452
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,880
Alright.

453
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah, that's good.

454
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,840
If there's nothing else, excuse me.

455
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,520
See ya.

456
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Goodbye.

457
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Oh.

458
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Easy, Mom.

459
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,880
Joe, I wanna go home.

460
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,350
Mom, the thing is the result came back already.

461
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,680
Mom...

462
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,840
I've asked the nurse already.

463
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,150
So you know...

464
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,310
Mmm.

465
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,430
There are so many diseases.

466
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,000
Why do I have to have the one that costs so much money.

467
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,270
It's alright, Mom.

468
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
I'm okay, darling.

469
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,230
Just knowing that you woke up and now you have a good job,

470
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,030
I'm not worried anymore. I can go see your Dad happily.

471
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,230
Mom, don't say that.

472
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,270
It's not deadly.

473
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Joe.

474
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,350
The only thing I feel guilty about...

475
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,600
is being your trouble.

476
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,270
I'm old.

477
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,640
I want you to save up the money for yourself.

478
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,350
No need to cure me.

479
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
How can I not cure you?

480
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,840
Are you gonna leave me alone like this?

481
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
And the reason you're like this because you worked too much...

482
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,030
in order to find the money to cure me.

483
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
And how can I not cure you now?

484
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,430
I'm sorry, darling.

485
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
It's alright, Mom.

486
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Why would you say sorry to me?

487
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,310
I've told you, from now on, I'll be the one who takes care of you.

488
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,230
Thank you so much, Son.

489
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
And have you eaten anything?

490
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,190
I have.

491
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,030
Take a lot of rest, Mom.

492
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,190
Alright.

493
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,720
Hello, is this Tong's movie accounting team?

494
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,000
I happen to have the urgent need for money.

495
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,070
Is it possible to have the money earlier than dated?

496
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,720
Joe's mom has a kidney failure. She's got no insurance.

497
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,680
And the minumum cost of the dialysis is 20,000 baht a month.

498
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,310
This doesn't include other expenses, Mr. Ming.

499
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Yes.

500
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,310
I'm sorry.

501
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,190
I'm sorry. / Are you alright?

502
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,190
I'm okay. I'm in a blur.

503
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,350
Can I talk to you?

504
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Yes.

505
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,000
Why didn't you tell me about your Mom when we were in the meeting?

506
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,760
Well... / Well, what? You can just tell me.

507
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,920
I think that you don't seem to like me.

508
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,430
So I didn't know why I'd tell you about it.

509
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Why?

510
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,920
Do you think I'll make fun of you?

511
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,150
No.

512
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,390
I'm just scared that if you knew about my Mom's condition,

513
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,920
you would unwillingly have me in your video.

514
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,470
And why would I do that?

515
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,310
Because you're a good person.

516
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,350
Am I right?

517
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
I don't dislike you.

518
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,430
I just don't like that you...

519
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,430
that you're like a guy I used to know.

520
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,230
Mr. Joe, right?

521
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,760
If it was Joe...

522
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,150
he wouldn't tell me about his Mom's condition as well.

523
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,800
He's very humble.

524
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,390
He would choose to put himself in trouble.

525
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,640
When he was banned,

526
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
he never thought about coming to me.

527
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,840
You're a good person.

528
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,800
I think he didn't want to drag you into his trouble.

529
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,270
How much?

530
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,600
What do you mean?

531
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,190
Your Mom's medical bill.

532
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,600
I'll lend you the money, and when you have the money,
you can just pay me back.

533
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
It's alright, thank you very much.

534
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,760
Well, I don't want to bother you,
and one more thing, we just met.

535
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,310
But I don't feel like that.

536
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,600
You're a good guy, Mr. Sol.

537
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,390
I don't want to drag you into my trouble.

538
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Just you listening to my story,

539
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
I really appreciate that.

540
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,880
You're so much like him.

541
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,070
But, I got a job coming.

542
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,760
I'll see you soon.

543
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,640
See me?

544
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,390
Well, my music video.

545
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,560
I choose you, and you can't say no.

546
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,430
Thank you.

547
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,390
Hello, Mr. Ming.

548
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,230
I have something to talk to you.

549
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,600
Come see me at my condo.

550
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm busy today.

551
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,640
I'll talk to you later.

552
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,110
Block him.

553
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,030
Are you going home?

554
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,600
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

555
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,110
Mr. Ming, you've given me a ride home.

556
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,720
What else do you want from me?

557
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
It's too much already.

558
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,310
That night, were you the one who got me home?

559
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,920
Yes, I went there with Secretary Jim.

560
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,030
I meant, were you the one who tucked me into bed?

561
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,920
Yes, I saw that you were very drunk.

562
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,270
I didn't know what to do, so I headed home after that.

563
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,150
Did I do anything to you that night?

564
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,520
I was in a blur too.

565
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I couldn't remember it.

566
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,070
Mr. Ming!

567
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,270
Mr. Ming!

568
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,150
What are you doing?

569
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,840
I just want to recall

570
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,310
why I did this to you.

571
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,720
Mr. Ming! Mr. Ming!

572
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,880
What exactly do you want from me?

573
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,800
Hey, Mr. Ming!

574
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
I'm asking you, what do you want from me?

575
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,110
Do you want to be famous?

576
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,680
Huh?

577
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,520
What role do you wanna play? What project do you wanna be in?

578
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,960
I can give you all of that if you just come stay with me.

579
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,520
I can give you all of that if you just come stay with me.

580
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,680
And why are you helping me?

581
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,960
You're like one person that I used to know.

582
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,760
So I want you to be his stand-in.

583
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,270
You're so much like him.

584
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,840
Like Tong?

585
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
Tong.

586
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,310
Why didn't you choose me?

587
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,880
A stand-in, right? A stand-in should be able to play anything...

588
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,310
I'll leave it to you?

589
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,030
Don't be so full of yourself.

590
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,600
You're just a stand-in.

591
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Mr. Ming!

592
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
Get out!

593
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,310
Get out of my house now!

594
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,680
I always get what I want.

595
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,600
Mr. Ming, if you're lonely...

596
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
I have so many people with good profiles...

597
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,070
He's so similar.

598
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,800
And, how much was it?

599
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,760
Three million Baht.

600
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,350
Oh, the first payment...

601
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,190
is the admission.

602
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,150
The X-ray, the doctor's treatment,

603
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,150
dialysis and filtration.

604
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,560
This is an incurable disease.

605
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,640
The patient must have dialysis every week.

606
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,070
And she'll have a normal life.

607
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,880
Do you want to be famous?

608
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,520
What role do you wanna play? What project do you wanna be in?

609
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,880
I can give you all of that if you just come stay with me.

610
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Joe.

611
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,800
Can you forget everything and go back to the way we were?

612
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,190
Ming, it's not your fault, it's mine.

613
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,190
I didn't know that I was just a stand-in.

614
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Don't worry.

615
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,800
I've told you, from now on, I'll be the one who takes care of you.

616
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,840
Five million Baht and a house for my Mom.

617
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,000
In exchange for one year of my life.

618
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,390
Do you think you're that worthy?

619
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,520
And what do you think?

620
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,680
Get used to it.

621
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,680
A year from now, there'll be more to come.
