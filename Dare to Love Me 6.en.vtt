00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.170
Pardon?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.330
Well, that was just a spam call. A spam.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.230
They keep telling me to buy land. Seriously...

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.940
It was the Teacher who texted me.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.060
The one who lives next door.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.680
Next door?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.670
If so, your friend who lives there is your teacher's-

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.610
younger brother.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.740
Young Master!

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:02.020
Seongsan Village's goods are also very popular abroad these days.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:07.500
People's interest in K-pop and K-contents is moving toward our tradition, too.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.040
It is tremendously rewarding.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.130
The goods produced by the artisans by hand are being recognized.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.840
That is such great news.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.340
Yes. Recently, an ignorant company abroad

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:24.010
tried to pay His Excellency Lee for his family's gochujang recipe.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:30.070
My goodness. So, I said, "Go back to your country."

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.550
I am glad you did.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.150
By the way, why did you wish to see me?

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.520
The thing is, Young Master...

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.810
Sir, please open the gate just once.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.470
I'll make sure the village doesn't suffer any damage.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.560
What? He said no again?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.020
Tell him, "Right back at you" immediately.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.950
What? "Right back at you"?

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.680
Say, "Right back at you," back to her.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.080
Right back at you, right back at you, right back at you.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.000
I said no, did I not?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.060
If you keep doing this, I will have to keep you out of Seongsan Village, too.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.660
If you keep doing this, I'll use the final solution.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.400
Tell her to do whatever she would like.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.520
No matter what she does, I would never open the gate.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:44.180
You went to Seongsan Village multiple times today because of that?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.950
I'm in such a difficult position.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.930
That's why I wanted to see you and ask for your help.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.820
Teacher.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.970
Yoon Bok.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.870
S-Shall we?

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.460
Let us.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.980
text

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.970
A way to persuade Grandfather?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.070
Yes. What does he like?

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.510
What would make him happy?

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.260
You are trying to make this work, too.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.440
She must be almost as stubborn as Grandfather.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.870
A fruit set? Or red ginseng?

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.710
Would he like that?

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.540
Is this that important to you?

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.300
Yes. It's my dream.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.270
Dream?

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:14.920
I can achieve my old dream if this fashion show happens.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.240
I really want to achieve it.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.650
That's why I'm asking you a favor again shamelessly.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.290
Are you free tomorrow, then?

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.690
Huh?

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.170
The only way to change Grandfather's mind is

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.950
to win over the people of the village.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.870
If they want it, he would change his mind, too.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.460
If so, how about tomorrow-

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.410
Would you go to Seongsan Village with me?

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.390
Yes, of course I do.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.760
Should I wear this?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.370
Would I look too desperate?

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.490
Would this be better?

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.240
Like this.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.360
Hey, hey! Which is better? This or this?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.270
- Huh?
- That.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.630
- This?
- Yes.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.610
- This is better?
- Yes.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.350
You chose this earlier!

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.270
- Yes, that.
- Geez, so annoying.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.960
It hurts.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.370
My body was always weak,

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.230
but my heart is feeling weak, too.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.530
Dear God, how could you be so cruel?

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:56.280
Why are you giving me a bitter day after a sweet night?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.490
Yoon Ah...

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.820
The customer can't answer the call right now. You'll be...

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.910
- Let us go.
- Shall we?

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.010
Hello.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.740
Walking together like this feels like we're hanging out in the past.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.640
You showed me around Seoul last time.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.130
Let us say I am letting you time-travel with me today.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.670
Hey, what do you mean by "travel"?

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.130
I'm a teacher, and you're a student.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.410
People might get the wrong idea.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.710
Don't be like that.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.750
Wrong idea? What do you mean...

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.360
Huh?

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.600
Well, I mean...

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.120
People might think we're on a school trip.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.970
My Lady!

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.970
Come on in.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.230
What? Young Master Yoon Bok is here?

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.340
Sir, are you in there?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.830
How pretty.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.500
Who is this?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.680
- Hello, sir.
- Aigoo, Yoon Bok.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.170
What brings you all the way here?

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.450
I came by to get your advice on something.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.160
Hello.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:54.250
I am sorry, but I am not interested in fashion shows.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.150
I will see you later.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.880
Sir.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.560
Are you in there?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.910
Yoon Bok.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.560
Have you been well?

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.920
We are planning to have a fashion show in the village.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.440
What? What would be the use of that?

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.000
I am against it.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.670
Hyungnim... H-Hyungnim!

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.800
Pardon? Open up the village?

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.340
I am against it.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.940
Pardon?

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.910
Open up the village?

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.840
Well, go ask someone else.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.500
The fashion show would help the village economy a lot.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.270
We do just fine without doing stuff like that.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.320
- Ma'am, get me another soup.
- Ma'am...

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.500
- Get me more kimchi!
- Okay.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.560
We can do it. Let's go.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.410
I am okay.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.130
Please, sir. Just one-

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.450
I said I was okay!

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.850
Sir! Sir, give me just a moment.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.080
Please, sir!

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.160
I am against it!

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.290
I am against it.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.750
I am against it.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.870
It is a no for me.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.200
Teacher, are you peckish at all?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.100
No.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.700
Are your legs tired?

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.600
Should we sit down a bit?

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.610
I'm okay.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.920
text

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.700
Teacher, please give me some time, too.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.800
What?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.090
"Love for Teacher" event for the disheartened teacher.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.180
It is Shin Yoon Bok's treat.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.800
- Let us go.
- Okay.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.610
Love?

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.890
I used to come here whenever I felt down.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.410
Hold this spoon up,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.880
disperse the red bean like this,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.710
and if you put it in your mouth, it tastes so sweet.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.540
Really? Should I try it, too?

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.030
I'll take a bite.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.840
It's so good.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.760
You told me once.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.570
That "sweet-salty-sweet-salty" is mandatory.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.020
Since you worked so hard today,

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.000
something sweet will happen tomorrow.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.190
Thank you.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.390
Whether it is a salty or sweet day,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.830
I will always cheer you up by your side.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.540
Do not be upset.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.080
Okay.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.860
How could my heart not race to this?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.270
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.940
Hello.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.180
Oh, hello.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.640
Did you come here with Yoon Bok again, by chance?

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.700
Yes.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.710
If so,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:16.900
did you eat this alone with him?

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.610
Yes.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.890
I will introduce myself formerly since you are his teacher.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:39.950
I am Lee Se Ryeong, and I am engaged to Yoon Bok.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.940
I see. I'm Kim Hong Do.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.120
But Yoon Bok said otherwise.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.780
- Pardon?
- Yoon Bok...

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.420
said he'd manage his marriage himself.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.500
There is no way.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.090
Lady Se Ryeong.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.370
My gosh!

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.080
Teacher!

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.240
Teacher, are you okay?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.480
Well, yes.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.380
My apologies, Yoon Bok.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.000
I did not mean to do that.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.800
Of course, you did not.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.970
But I do not think you should apologize to me.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.330
I'm okay.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.030
My apologies.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.650
It's okay.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.750
Are you hurt at all?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.150
No, I'm okay.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.810
- Are you okay?
- As long as you do not show up out of nowhere,

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.930
I would be just fine.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.140
There's no one outside.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.640
I already checked before I came out.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.390
What is it that you want?

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.150
Follow me.

Have you decided on the date and location?

The date is to be determined, but the location has been decided.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:39.520
The Camille fashion show location in Korea will be...

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.370
Seongsan Village.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.610
Seongsan Village?

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:57.710
Is there a specific reason you decided to have a fashion show in Seongsan Village?

Hong Do Kim.

She's my source of inspiration who brought me to Korea.

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:18.700
Starting with this show, Hong Do Kim will show off her talents in Paris.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.910
She will be Camille's rising star.
