WEBVTT

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.800
Please forgive me.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
Out of concern for your safety,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.220
I rudely laid my hands on you.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.020
So it was you.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.350
Well, it's not your first time.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.650
Pardon me?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.360
What?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.900
I mean, thank you for catching my fall.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.620
It's nice to see you after so long,
but I'm a bit exhausted.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.910
Should we call it a night?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.120
It is late. Allow me to walk--

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.170
No, I'm all right.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.800
Goodnight then.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840
In that case,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.180
I shall go now.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010
Goodbye, Master.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.440
What are you doing?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.690
It is impolite for a pupil
to show his back to his master.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.910
You crazy fool.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.790
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.080
Why did it have to be you?

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.800
I wanted to be remembered
as an admirable master.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.430
Whatever. I won't ever see him again.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.220
Bye, Yoon-bok.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.020
It's a shame,
but let's never cross paths again.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.400
Oh my.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.400
This is so humiliating.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.160
EPISODE 2
A MAN OF MANNERS

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.650
BASED ON THE WEBTOON
DARE TO LOVE ME BY SUN WOO

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.220
Did you sleep well, Master?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.480
Are you all right?

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.150
Why are you here, Yoon-bok?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.410
I did not have the opportunity
to inform you yesterday,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.660
but I will be residing here briefly
due to a personal matter.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.120
Oh.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.000
I see.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.540
I apologize if I startled you.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.880
It's all right.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.300
No worries. It happens.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.720
Have a good day then.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.350
Why is he there?

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.110
What am I looking at?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.860
Oh dear.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.950
I can't believe this.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.030
This is so embarrassing!

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.210
Oh, right. You don't know yet.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.170
Guess who moved in next door?

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.800
You'll be shocked when you find out.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.550
Should I tell you or not?

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.770
The person who moved in is…

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.360
Out of all the houses
in the sprawling city of Seoul,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.860
why did it have to be that one?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.320
Wait, you saw Yoon-bok already?

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.660
He was in urgent need of a place to stay

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.320
and asked me for help.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.120
I was his best friend
at the academy, you know?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.290
So I recommended
that place right next to us.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.290
I see. So it was you?

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.250
Oh, right.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.380
He probably heard you
lose your mind last night.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.550
You better shut it.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.130
How embarrassing.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.930
I better warn him to look out
while he's here.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.810
I told you to shut up!

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.020
Look at you.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.170
Hello, Ji-won?

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.630
I should hurry?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.010
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.900
Right.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.960
My goodness, I'm sorry.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.880
Sorry about that.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.160
Oh dear.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.700
It seems I dropped it again.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.550
Why is it that Master Kim
avoids me so ardently?

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.010
Could it be

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.100
that I have done something wrong?

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.530
Is there a chance

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.120
you might let me in tonight?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.550
Do you not see
what I have adorned myself with?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.140
You still refuse to allow me in?

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.930
Why?

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.480
VIP ONLY

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.950
I witnessed suspicious figures
going through the VIP entrance.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.960
I must step foot
into that room tonight at all costs.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.050
The ways of a club rat
are much too perplexing for me.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.100
I shall devote myself to becoming
a club rat as soon as possible.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.330
Yeah, I'm at Jay Club!

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.170
I just got here.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.790
VIP ENTRANCE

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.550
VIP ONLY

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.220
How is your morning?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.970
Might you be free for a brief meeting?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.310
What?

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.980
Where do you want me to take you?

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.850
I will follow your lead

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.980
no matter what.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.700
How long do I have to avoid Yoon-bok?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.530
What should we get for dinner?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.120
What about the place
we had to rush out of that time?

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.040
Seongsangwan?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.870
I thought they didn't accept
same-day reservations.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.300
Only if there was someone
who could wait in line for us.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.390
Hong-do.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.400
Yes?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.950
Could you wait in line
at Seongsangwan for us?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.120
Me?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.410
This isn't a personal request.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.500
We're having a meeting
to discuss future projects and such.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.040
Oh, is that so?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.510
Sure.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.560
Wait, let me add a prop.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.280
What is it?

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.750
-Go ahead.
-Sure.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.960
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.680
LEE DO-YEONG, FOR 2 PEOPLE

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.980
Here we go.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.780
I cannot do this.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.860
Come on, trust me.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.200
You want to give up?

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.160
-This is too--
-Stop talking and take it off!

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.580
-Now this.
-Absolutely not.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.540
-Just do as I say.
-Please, spare me.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.180
Is there anything less flashy?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.940
Looks great.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.000
This is extremely gaudy.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.130
If you want to be a club rat,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.590
you need to put your full trust in me.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.010
This is unacceptable.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.430
I shall wear my robe
and convince the gatekeepers.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.270
No, you won't!

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.810
You used to wear
school uniforms, didn't you?

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.360
That was simply my duty as a student.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.610
Correct.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.820
This is just the same.
Do your duty to the club.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.650
That is highly contradictory.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.410
Okay.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.580
I put you through too much too soon.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.950
Let's tone it down a bit.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.610
Please tone it down slightly more.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.900
You can't tone it down more than this.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.040
What do you say I wear that instead?

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.050
I'm so excited.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.340
Name, please.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.420
Lee Do-yeong.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.590
-This way.
-Thank you.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.180
This is nice.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.520
Mr. Lee!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.230
What took you so long?

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.280
You're such a great guy.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.030
I can't believe you set this up for us.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.360
I'm so touched.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.830
Mr. Lee is paying
for a team dinner tonight.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.080
Excuse me. Just a moment.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.130
LEE DO-YEONG, FOR 20 PEOPLE

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.290
Give him a big hand!

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.420
Have a seat.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.260
-Get in here!
-Come sit!

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.470
Did Hong-do do this?

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.050
I think so.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.810
-Lee Do-yeong!
-Lee Do-yeong!

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.480
PR TEAM ASSISTANT MANAGER LEE DO-YEONG

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.940
FELLOW INTERN HAN JI-WON

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.240
Hey, Ji-won. Where are you?
Aren't you at the team dinner?

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.450
That's the same as overtime
for us interns.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.750
Let's go blow off some steam instead.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.540
A club?

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.580
With that kind of money…

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.090
Oh, for free?

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.130
Where to?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.930
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.670
Right.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.270
VIP ENTRANCE

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.430
Thank you.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.810
I will repay my debt to you someday.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.680
Sure thing.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.590
Master Kim?

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.410
Greetings, Master.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.750
We meet again.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.250
Yoon-bok!

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.180
What brings you here?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.510
I have a business to attend to.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.760
I see.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.600
Seeing you here makes me want to die…

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.100
Die of joy!

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.860
There was one place I could not enter.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.110
It's the VIP room.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.320
I made an attempt,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.820
but I was rebuffed due to its exclusivity.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.950
Please excuse me. I must go now.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.290
Okay, bye.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.800
-This can't be real!
-Who was that?

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.010
-We need to leave!
-No! The party's just getting started!

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.140
We're leaving now!

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.260
No, I want to party!

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.100
Who the hell are you?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.690
Apologies.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.250
Enter through VIP room five.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.820
-The crowd tonight is no joke.
-Let's go, Ji-won!

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.900
What did you say?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.530
Let's leave.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.740
No, the party's heating up!

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.120
Excuse me.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.460
Coming through.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.380
Sorry.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.760
Jeez!

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.140
I'm sorry.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.220
Come here.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.140
-Hey!
-Yes?

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.100
An eye for an eye

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.440
and a foot for a foot.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.270
-Stick your foot out.
-Sorry?

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.810
I said stick your foot out.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.820
Oh jeez.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.250
He's a VIP?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.550
An eye for an eye and a foot for a foot?

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.220
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.180
Who are you?

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.970
Is she your girl?

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.220
I was just passing by.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.140
I wanted to turn a blind eye
as I have urgent business to attend to,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.900
but my boss taught me
not to ignore injustice.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.280
You little…

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.240
Hey, you!

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.410
Our boss said not to cause any trouble.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.580
Let's go!

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.410
You better watch your back!

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.380
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.010
I will escort you to safety.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:55.110
Do not lose confidence
just because you are a weak man.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.660
My strong lady,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.410
please reveal to me your name.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.500
Kim Hong-hak!

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.920
You're…

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.840
dead.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.600
Damn it.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.770
Who were they?

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.820
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.360
-What the heck?
-Damn it.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.700
Are you Phony?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.210
I don't know who that is.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.170
But you don't seem to be on their side,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.670
so please untie me.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.360
What's this?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.980
Who are you?

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.480
Who are you?

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.490
Are you Phony or Phony's subordinates?

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.700
What is he saying?

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.200
Are you out of your mind, you bastard?

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.160
Who the hell are you?

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.000
How rude of you.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.960
Screw this!

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.440
Are you the thief
who steals cultural assets?

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.150
I follow the gangster's code.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.950
I let my fists do the talking,
but I don't steal things.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.620
Young Master!

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.830
Yun-a.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.090
Yun-a!

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.850
They managed to steal folding screens,
pottery, and even statues of Buddha.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.980
Wait, who's that?

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.520
I found him bound inside,
but I doubt he is Phony.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.230
While I question him,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.400
please search for the men who escaped.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.530
The thugs here all know each other.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.240
I'll find them in no time.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.920
Are you all right?

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.550
Yes, you do not need to worry.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.140
Where do you reside?
I shall escort you home.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.190
I don't know who Phony or whatever is.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:24.360
I was just offered money
to transport goods for them.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.410
And the client gave me this.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:29.530
Who's the client?

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.370
I have no idea.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.500
All I get are texts from a burner phone,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.790
so there's no way to know.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.380
Anyway, I'm innocent.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.250
You can tell, can't you?

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.800
I'm an innocent man
and a law-abiding citizen.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.390
Then how is it that someone like yourself
was bound in there?

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.270
The thing is,

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.140
I happened

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.560
to see something

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.360
I shouldn't have seen.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.580
STOLEN EIGHT-PANEL FOLDING SCREEN!
IS PHONY RESPONSIBLE?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.630
WOORIM

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.220
What is the matter?

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.430
Did you see this person's face?

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.190
Take care.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.610
Thank you.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.330
-Let us go.
-Yes, Young Master.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.040
Who are you?

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.470
Are you all right?

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.090
I…

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.510
remember.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.470
I'm sorry.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.770
Understood.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.110
He had a burn

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.200
on his arm.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.710
You opened your piggy bank for a club?

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:25.500
Are you out of your mind?!

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.170
It's not like I'm the only one who went.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.260
You were there too.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.380
I went for free, okay?

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.930
And why did you bring Yoon-bok?

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.220
This is so unfair.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.730
He's the one who wanted to go.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.520
You need to practice lying.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.980
Yoon-bok going to a club?
Who would believe that?

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.610
You know what?

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.400
Let's go.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.820
Go where?

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.240
To clear the air with Yoon-bok!

00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.950
Hey.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.450
Forget it.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.160
Don't be dramatic.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.250
What did you just say?

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.800
You want me to take in that strange man?

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.260
He has reasons to stay hidden,
so please let him stay here.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.640
But he's from the outside.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.850
And I'm a very sensitive person.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:30.150
I lie awake sleepless
even at the slightest noise.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.360
I hear your favorite singer

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.360
will hold a concert nearby
this coming fall.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:39.700
You mean Myeong-jun?

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.580
I hear songs can be more touching
when heard in person.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.710
You would get me a ticket?

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:55.590
I suppose I can hold in
my sensitive nature for a little while.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.300
Is he good at anything?

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.810
Please make sure he is not seen by anyone.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:05.730
One more thing.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.400
Inform me if you observe
any suspicious behavior.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.370
Is this not the key
to the village storage?

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.870
My father had always carried it with him
when he was alive.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.550
WOORIM

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.760
Yoon-bok.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.890
Today is the day Seongsan Gate
will be opened for the first time.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.070
Make sure to remember the day
our village was reborn.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:35:00.490
If the village is reborn,
we should celebrate its birthday.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.990
That we should.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.960
I must attend to business at the moment,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.080
so let us celebrate when I return.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.050
-Goodness!
-What is going on?

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.890
My lord!

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.530
To my knowledge,
the key had been lost in the fire.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.160
How did they end up in Phony's hands?

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.160
That we must find out.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.540
Grandfather might worry,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.960
so let us keep this matter between us
for the time being.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.420
Understood.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.520
I hear Yoon-bok recovered another asset.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.030
You must be deeply proud
that your grandson inherited

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.780
your exceptional ability
to recover precious assets.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.370
I must petition the president
to reward your family handsomely

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:33.080
after generations of exceptional service.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.290
We do not deserve to be rewarded

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.130
for failing to protect
what must be protected.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.010
Your sense of duty is truly remarkable.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.220
May I ask why Yoon-bok returned to Seoul?

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.850
He has made a firm vow
to eliminate Phony and their thievery.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.980
I could not blunt his will.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.150
What if something terrible happens to him?

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.110
Young Master Yoon-bok's father's
early death is still fresh in my memory.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.610
Watch it.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.830
Forgive me.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.250
I was concerned for the safety
of your only descendant.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.670
SEONGSAN VILLAGE

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.390
Greetings, Lord Gatekeeper.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.640
How dare you?

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.310
Did Lord Shin Su-keun
not order all visitors

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.390
to wear appropriate garments?

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.060
My apologies.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.150
I had no time
as I was short on ingredients.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.110
I shall take what I need and leave.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:44.690
Open the gates.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.030
Thank you.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.120
SEONGSANGWAN

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.040
-This way, please.
-All right.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.890
Are you okay?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.270
Lady Se-ryung!

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.440
Are you all right?

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.860
How dare you, Jun-ho!

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
Are you hurt?

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.490
No, my lord. I was only startled.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.000
Are you out of your mind?

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.120
Have I not told you
to drive slowly in the village?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.050
You almost hurt yet another person
due to your negligence!

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.270
You fool!

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.060
Did you cause that precious child

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.690
to become ill?

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.530
When you ran away as a child,

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.570
I was going to forbid you
from ever returning.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.950
It was your mother's plea that forced me
to give you a second chance.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.120
And yet you are careless in all you do,
putting others in danger!

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.090
Please forgive him, my lord.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.170
What are you doing?

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.680
Beg for forgiveness!

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.300
I am deeply sorry.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.310
If this ever happens again,

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.890
you will be forbidden
from driving in the village.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.350
So be careful.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480
Yes, my lord.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.070
Let us go, Se-ryung.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.620
That old man hasn't changed a bit.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.870
Watch what you say, you brat!

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.920
Goodness.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.640
Why are you here?

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.650
I'm here for a reason.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.650
My life at work has been
so chaotic because of you.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.580
What are you doing?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.870
I'm sorry, Hong-do.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.880
So please…

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.260
Please just quit your job.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.880
What?

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.390
You're making things
so uncomfortable for me.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.510
I apologized, didn't I?
Now you return my favor.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.720
Unbelievable.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.690
You somehow always manage
to exceed my expectations.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.820
I'm even kneeling, aren't I?
It's more than you asked for!

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.030
So just get lost, Kim Hong-do!

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.610
No, you get lost.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.030
Hey, Kim Hong-do!

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.660
Listen carefully.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.080
If you're uncomfortable, then you quit.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.410
I'm never going to quit.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.830
Now let go of me.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.040
Let go!

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.840
Just get lost, Kim Hong-do!

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.180
How dare you lay hands on her?

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.480
Do you feel no shame in exerting violence

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.190
against a former lover?

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.780
Who the heck are you? It's none of your…

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.070
You're the guy who helped her that night.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.370
We can talk later.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.250
So what are you two?

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.670
You treat me like trash,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.550
yet you were seeing this punk.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.920
It's not like that.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.760
Do not lay hands on her

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.390
ever again.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.770
All right, so let me go now!

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.860
Decorum has deserted you.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.530
Keep this in mind.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.780
Manners maketh man.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.240
Damn it.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.920
Are you all right, Master?

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.840
Once again, it's Yoon-bok.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.430
Whenever I'm down in the dumps…

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.930
Are you all right?

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.810
…Yoon-bok comes to my aid.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.280
Thank you for helping me.
I'll get going first.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.660
Allow me to escort you to your home.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.540
It's all right. I can go alone.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.540
No, Master.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.210
A pupil must not allow his master

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.790
to travel alone with dangerous men
out and about in the night.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.170
I'm all right.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.050
-However--
-I said I'm all right!

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.210
Why do you keep insisting?

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.220
Why?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.050
Are you my bodyguard?

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.470
Why do you keep helping me?

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.270
I can go alone.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.680
I'm going alone.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.020
Yoon-bok,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.280
there's no shame in being different.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.360
Whatever people think of you,
you're amazing just as you are.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:50.370
It was through her guidance
that I entered this world in confidence.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:51.620
So why is it

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.960
that she continues to avoid me?

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.250
Could it be?

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.760
It's been so long.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.880
Has it been seven years?

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:08.300
Yes, it has been a long time.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.720
I spoke my first words with a lie.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.690
I sought to offer
these flowers to you, Master.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.150
Please accept
the humble gratitude of your pupil.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:23.820
Oh my goodness.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.830
Did you sleep well, Master?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.580
I made her feel anxious
with my abrupt appearances.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.040
I said I'm all right!

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.130
Why do you keep insisting?

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.050
Why?

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:44.880
Are you my bodyguard?

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.590
Why do you keep helping me?

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.510
I made her feel uncomfortable
and provoked her into a state of anger.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.020
What a fool I have been.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.020
I have committed

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.770
a great offense against Master Kim.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.240
Was I too harsh?

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:20.750
Oh dear!

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.300
Yoon-bok.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.220
What are you doing here?

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.640
Get up.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.260
I cannot.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:34.720
I have committed a grave sin against you.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.520
I will not stand

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.400
until you forgive me.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.360
What are you talking about?

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.940
I now understand
why you have been avoiding me.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:47.700
What?

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.030
Gunsabuilche.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.990
A master is like a king and a father

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.450
and must be treated with utmost respect

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.120
without crossing a line.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.790
And yet,

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.920
I foolishly ignored that line
and crossed it as I saw fit.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.250
I cannot imagine the sorrow
and disappointment you must have felt

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.550
at my transgressions.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.300
Could you be so merciful
as to forgive my impertinence?

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.340
Goodness.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:16.850
This is ridiculous.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.770
It's not what you think, so get up.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.060
Come on.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.560
I cannot stand until I am forgiven.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.650
Get up, Yoon-bok. Now!

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:45.500
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.460
I wasn't avoiding you
because you did something wrong.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.180
Then may I humbly ask

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.640
why you have been avoiding me?

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.230
Well…

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.480
It wasn't because you were rude to me.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.610
I was just embarrassed.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.700
Pardon me?

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.240
Hey.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.870
How could I not be embarrassed

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:19.660
when I was drunk
and showed you my worst self?

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.920
As you said, I behaved disgracefully

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.380
to my pupil as a master.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.960
As if that wasn't enough,
I embarrassed myself again earlier.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.300
That's why.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:34.220
It is all right.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:36.680
What?

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.020
You do not need to be ashamed of yourself.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.600
Whatever people might think of you,

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:51.240
you are amazing
just as you are, Master.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.530
From now on,

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.530
I will pay close attention
to your heart and words.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:00.080
Therefore…

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.420
please do not avoid me.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.300
Okay, I won't.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:23.480
I won't ever avoid you again.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.560
Finally…

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.400
the burden on my chest has been lifted.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.830
-Let's go.
-Pardon me?

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:47.330
I never got to welcome you as my neighbor
because I was busy avoiding you.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.000
It's a bit late,
but let me give you a proper welcome.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.800
This is a rare opportunity, you know?

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.430
I'm known around here
as a big old Scrooge.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.100
I'm spending big tonight,
so I'll treat you to whatever you want.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.600
However,

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.310
there will not be a place
that is open at this hour.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.560
Oh, I know a place.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.650
It's open 24 hours
and I'm a regular there.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.700
It concerns me
that you might have overspent.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:22.910
Not at all.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:27.540
But are you uncomfortable
sharing a table with me?

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.670
That is preposterous.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.290
Then why are you over there?

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:37.170
As I have said,
a master is like a king and a father.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.840
I could never dream
of sharing a table with my master.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.520
But you see, this isn't Seongsan Village.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.390
-However--
-This makes me uncomfortable.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.770
My neck is straining
because I keep having to look back.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:55.070
And didn't you say
you'd pay close attention to my words?

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:01.200
If you feel such discomfort,

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:03.410
I shall move.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.790
Good.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.270
You've changed a lot, Yoon-bok.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.820
In what way?

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.700
Well…

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.870
You're more confident.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.450
You're like a super confident scholar.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.210
It is all thanks to you.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.420
And you're cheesy now.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.960
You've really changed.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.300
At that time,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.510
I had fearfully escaped the burden

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:05.390
placed on my shoulders.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:10.930
But once I met you,
I gained the courage to return.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.560
I meditated on your teachings every day.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.570
I strived not to crumble under my fears,

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.360
what I believed was right,

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.820
and my grandfather's scoldings.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.290
Just like you,

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.250
I desired to be confident.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:36.840
Confident?

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.010
Was I confident?

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.880
Yes.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.180
To me, you are the most amazing
and precious person

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.680
in the entire world.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.740
How did you get this injury, Master?

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.700
What?

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.990
Oh, this? It's no big deal.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.830
-I was working and--
-Please excuse me.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.260
BAND-AID

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:30.140
Please apply this
to your wound before it gets infected.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:33.180
Whenever I'm down in the dumps,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.940
Yoon-bok comes to my aid.

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.150
It's as if…

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.070
he's my bodyguard.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.910
Why are you so far away, Yoon-bok?

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.080
I dare not step on your shadow.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.840
I see.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.420
Yes, Master.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.340
Do you have any hobbies?

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.930
I enjoy drawing.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.300
Oh, right.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.260
That's why you went to the academy.

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.010
What do you like to eat?

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.020
I like vegetables.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.480
I see.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.940
-Do you have a favorite celebrity?
-I do not.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.110
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:24.940
No, Master.

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:26.860
I see.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.120
What's your number?

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.500
-Pardon me?
-So we can stay in contact.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:43.840
I must refuse.

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.630
I could not dream

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:48.630
of exchanging phone numbers
and becoming friends with my master.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.090
It's really not a big deal.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.810
I am fine.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.400
Okay.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.310
Did you sleep well, Master?

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.220
Yes, thank you for asking.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.780
Did you sleep well, Yoon-bok?

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.960
Yes, I did.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.840
Starting today,
I'm not letting anyone walk over me.

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.860
SPOTLIGHT INFLUENCER-APPROVED

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.280
JUNG YI-RANG APPROVED!
LUCKY POUCH TRENDING!

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.540
Losi Fashion is trending hot
thanks to Hyang-gi!

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.500
-Lee Hyang-gi!
-Lee Hyang-gi!

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.880
You surely carry us on your back.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.960
-You all should learn from her.
-I should.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.670
What's that?

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:44.550
Oh, this?

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.220
It was on the ground.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.760
I think someone left it.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.230
No wonder.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.600
Learn from me, okay?

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.690
Did you design this yourself, Hyang-gi?

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:04.030
It just looks too much like my design.

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.490
What are you talking about?

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:08.990
What can you even do, Kim Hong-do?

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.710
Let me get this straight.

00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:19.710
Are you accusing me of copying you?

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.420
Yes.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.800
Hey, Kim Hong-do!

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.630
How dare you?

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.590
Do you know what amateurs often mistake?

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.560
They believe their ideas are unique.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.560
But that's not true.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.770
Everyone else notices
the trends you notice.

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:39.980
I know the pouch looks like
something you'd carry around,

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.230
but you can't just say that
without any proof.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.070
What if I do have proof?

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.280
What?

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:52.580
Here.

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.120
It is really similar!

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.540
Did she actually copy it?

00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.920
The great Hyang-gi would never…

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.380
LUCKY POUCH

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.510
Is this true, Hyang-gi?

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:06.380
No.

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.090
I didn't even know
Hong-do was on social media.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.050
I'm sure you saw it in real life.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.600
I gave it to Do-yeong as a birthday gift.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.140
You gave it to Do-yeong?

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:30.660
It's true.

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:32.950
I met Hong-do that day.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.870
Oh my.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.580
She offered to do my work
so I met up with her.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.290
And we met again
because she said she'd give me a gift.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.340
But it seems like she misunderstood.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.250
What?

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.260
When I told her I was dating Hyang-gi…

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:50.840
You remember the team dinner we had?

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.970
That was supposed
to be just me and Hyang-gi,

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.770
but I guess she got jealous or something
and got a group reservation.

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:02.770
Seeing as we were all already there,
I was happy to treat everyone, but…

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.650
I felt so bad for Hyang-gi.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.530
I had promised her
a night out with just us two.

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.620
I'm sorry, Hyang-gi.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:18.660
That's what happened?

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.920
We really had no idea.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.420
What's wrong with you, Hong-do?

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.380
You know this counts as stalking, right?

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.960
Wait a minute.

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:29.590
That's not the issue here.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.180
-The pouch design is--
-You can be mean to me!

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.060
But leave Hyang-gi alone.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.180
Hey, Lee Do-yeong.

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.810
Stop! Or you're getting fired.

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.270
Get back to work!

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.900
-But…
-I can't believe her.

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.190
-What's wrong with her?
-She's too much.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.440
How could she do that?

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.700
-How can someone do that?
-I know, right?

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.310
Hey!

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:14.340
Even when the world walks all over me,

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.630
I know there's one person

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.680
who would never do so.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.900
THANK YOU TO LIM HO AND JUNG YI-RANG
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCES

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:55.550
EPILOGUE

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:56.760
Hey, friend!

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.100
What do you say we flip through
some comics and reminisce?

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.600
Very well.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.610
Oh no. It's raining.

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:16.780
Did Hong-do take an umbrella?

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.240
Whatever, who cares? Just come over.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.040
Yoon-bok's come a long way.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.210
Was he always that handsome?

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:37.250
-Who am I speaking to?
-How have you been, Yoon-bok?

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:41.050
How can I come to work after being framed
for copying a mere assistant's design?

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.640
Are you saying it doesn't matter
that I get walked over?

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.300
How dare you?

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.560
I'll see to it that you never
get another job in this industry.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.520
Hey, bro!

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.600
Hey, Yoon-bok.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.100
Yoon-bok!

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:56.190
