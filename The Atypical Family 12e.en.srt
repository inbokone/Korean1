1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,621
Looks like a rash from plants.

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,082
It's nothing serious. It'll go away soon.

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,504
How long will it last?

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,883
Well, some go away in a few hours.

6
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,468
But it could last over a week.

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,098
Does it sting a lot?

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,812
Apply this regularly,
and it'll go away in no time.

9
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,898
Thank you.

10
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,339
This is not okay.

11
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,925
It's just too soon.

12
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,359
Da-hae, what are you doing here?

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,613
Your mother dreamed about you
getting rained on by the pharmacy.

14
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,992
She was so worried
you wouldn't pick up your phone.

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,372
So I interpreted that dream for her.

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,752
I told her it meant
we would share an umbrella on our date.

17
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,421
Even though you can't change the future,

18
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,258
you can decide how to respond to it.

19
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,761
Why are you here anyway?

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,185
Let's get on with our date.

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,314
Let's go.

22
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,276
Guys, look at her.

23
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,154
Is Goh Hye-rim an outcast now?

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,655
Serves her right.

25
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,824
Lucky her.
She gets that huge table to herself.

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,743
-I know.
-Totally.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,995
That's so funny.

28
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,372
Like a fallen queen.

29
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,801
What do you want?

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,182
Do you pity me?

31
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,439
We need you.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,025
Come back.

33
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,613
What's I-na doing over there?

34
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,530
What's with her?

35
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,578
I can't wait for you guys
to perform without me

36
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,538
and make fools of yourselves.

37
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,625
You're lying. I know you want to join us.

38
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,835
What do you know?

39
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,713
You practice alone at home.
The final pose and all.

40
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,382
Hey, that's not true.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,800
It doesn't matter.

42
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,969
I'm not asking you to join us
for your sake.

43
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,472
It's what I want.

44
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,183
I'm going to follow my heart.

45
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,353
-What?
-And my heart wants you back.

46
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,815
Dance with us.

47
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,573
Forget it.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,700
You're so full of yourself.

49
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,104
-Bok Don't Eat.
-I'm busy.

50
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,856
I brought someone with me.

51
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,445
Come in.

52
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,700
Ta-da. This is him.

53
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,954
He's a little rough around the edges,
but he's kind-hearted.

54
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,003
This is unexpected.

55
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,213
You should've talked to me first.

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,756
It's unfair to him.

57
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,427
I'm not interested in dating right now.

58
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,845
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm not setting you up with him.

60
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,392
You said you needed more trainers
because of all the new members.

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,154
Wait, he seems familiar.

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,655
Right.

63
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,074
You've probably seen him at the sauna.

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,451
He's actually my uncle.

65
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,329
Our grand scheme went south,

66
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,205
so he urgently needs a job.

67
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,084
I've seen him somewhere else.

68
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,253
Have we met before?

69
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,309
He never let the food get cold.

70
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,103
He never spilled a single drop of soup.

71
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,774
He never got the food shifted to one side.
He kept it perfectly packaged.

72
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,735
It was as if

73
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,822
it had just been made.

74
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,493
Right, actually…

75
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,704
that was to spy on you
as part of the scam.

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,048
Is that a turn-on for you?

77
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,308
I'll destroy all of you.

78
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,064
Ji-han?

79
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
How long have you been following me?

80
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,202
The day

81
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,163
you debuted as a model,

82
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,874
I knew right away.

83
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,795
That we're cut from the same cloth.

84
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,340
-What do you mean?
-I also have

85
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,593
a special power that no one else has.

86
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,016
When I was four,

87
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,478
I taught myself
the Korean alphabet and arithmetic.

88
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,940
I was gifted, and I was educated as such.

89
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,861
-Even you liked me because I was a doctor.
-I don't know.

90
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,655
It was such a long time ago.

91
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,242
You're special.

92
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,164
And I'm special enough to be with you.

93
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,999
The salad café girl? Grace?

94
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,293
They're just common broads.

95
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,545
You're really dragging this out.

96
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,506
Get to the point
so I can get back to running.

97
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,798
Let's get married.

98
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

99
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,553
All my life,

100
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,598
I've never failed at anything.

101
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,141
I can't let my life

102
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
fail like this.

103
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,770
My life was a series of failures

104
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,065
until I realized my uniqueness.

105
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,819
Not the kind that everyone can see,

106
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,449
but the true uniqueness
only seen by those who love me.

107
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,952
I hope you find someone who can see yours.

108
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,079
Is this about that gorilla?

109
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,915
Marry me.

110
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,124
Or else,

111
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,254
I'll spread this all over the internet.

112
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,171
Go ahead.

113
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,258
Anyone can make a fake video these days.

114
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,051
No one will believe you.

115
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,053
Are we done here?

116
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:15,972
No.

117
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,808
If you won't marry me,

118
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,520
at least give me back my money.

119
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,981
-Two billion won.
-Two billion won?

120
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,442
I lost everything, damn it.

121
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,821
I took out loans because of you,
and I'm drowning in debt now.

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,657
I lost my clinic and my car!

123
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,202
I know it was only 200 million.

124
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,249
Hey!

125
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,293
I'm posting this!

126
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm serious!

127
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,421
I'm gonna do it!

128
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,630
Damn it.

129
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,132
I swear to god…

130
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,182
Oops.

131
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,726
My bad.

132
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,893
That hurts.

133
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,314
I'll pick that up for you.

134
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,524
Damn it, my phone.

135
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,531
-I said I got it.
-Don't touch that.

136
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,992
Leave my phone alone.

137
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,582
Oops.

138
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,293
You're bleeding.

139
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,295
Blood…

140
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,259
How did you find me?

141
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,347
-Hey.
-Yes?

142
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,807
Take it.

143
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,810
Okay. Thank you.

144
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,563
I appreciate it.

145
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,487
Oops.

146
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,116
No! My phone!

147
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,245
No! Where did it go?

148
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,039
-Where is it?
-My bad.

149
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,957
My phone!

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,629
Damn you!

151
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,132
I swear I'll kill you!

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,440
Are you okay?

153
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,445
I saw students trembling with fear.

154
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,824
Some covered themselves with blankets.

155
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,421
What else?

156
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,964
A clock.

157
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,258
It was on the school building.

158
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,307
Some were flailing in the air.

159
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,646
In the air?

160
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,196
Hey, newbie!

161
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,244
How have you been, sir?

162
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,788
It's good to see you, kid!

163
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,543
-What?
-Were there people flailing in the air

164
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,504
or students jumping out the windows?

165
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,300
Come on, man.

166
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,969
Are you still on about that?

167
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,222
There's something left for me to do.

168
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,390
I don't know, man.

169
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,518
It's been over ten years.
I don't remember all that.

170
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,395
Then show me the report.

171
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,898
I'd appreciate it.

172
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,651
When it starts boiling,
turn the heat down and let it simmer.

173
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,069
Okay.

174
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,406
Turn the heat…

175
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,256
What else do you want to learn?

176
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
Your favorite dish.

177
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,308
-Mine?
-Yes.

178
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,395
Well…

179
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,816
It's just been so long

180
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,320
since someone asked me what I liked.

181
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,744
From now on,
I'll ask you from time to time.

182
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,965
Pick up.

183
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,134
You can't do this to me.

184
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,847
Think about when you let yourself go.

185
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,767
I reached out to you
when no one else would.

186
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,396
No one else could have put
up with your family.

187
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,442
I'm going to expose you monsters
to the entire world.

188
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,113
Keep ignoring me,
and I'll set everything on fire…

189
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,116
Food's ready, Dong-hee.

190
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,745
Who is it?

191
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,374
It's just spam.

192
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,841
See you at the show, Hye-rim.

193
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,844
We'll be waiting. Please be there.

194
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,722
Hey.

195
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
Are you ready for the competition?

196
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,769
I guess.

197
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,023
Something smells good.

198
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,115
Dig in, everyone.

199
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,876
Try some eggplant, I-na.

200
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,174
You should eat.

201
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,350
Here's some salad.

202
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,271
What's with the turtleneck?

203
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,273
Isn't it uncomfortable?

204
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,194
I think I have a cold.

205
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,364
More stew, anyone?

206
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,910
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

207
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,996
Thank you for helping.

208
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,456
I hope everyone likes it.

209
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,375
Why didn't you tell me?

210
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,594
We should tell everyone.

211
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,433
Tomorrow is a big day for I-na.

212
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,060
And for me.

213
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,855
-I don't want to mess it up.
-Is that…

214
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,566
Is that important right now?

215
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,692
It's just one day.

216
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,738
Let's keep it a secret
until tomorrow, okay?

217
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,837
I prayed day and night

218
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,007
that this wouldn't happen.

219
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,134
How?

220
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,511
Where did you get it?

221
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
In the past.

222
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,151
This means the fire from 13 years ago

223
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,362
can hurt you as well.

224
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,198
It means that I can

225
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,617
finally reach you 13 years ago.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,919
I thought I could stop it.

227
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
I wanted to change the future.

228
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,758
Was I wrong?

229
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,138
In the end…

230
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,685
So what now?

231
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,396
What should we do, Gwi-ju?

232
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,401
You weren't wrong.

233
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,323
No need to panic over a rash.

234
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,992
They say it'll never go away.

235
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,413
We'll get to decide

236
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
when we say goodbye.

237
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
On my 99th birthday.

238
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,922
Nothing's changed.

239
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,040
Did you get any sleep?

240
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,883
I brought you some water.

241
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,305
What is it now?

242
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,023
I had another bad dream.

244
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,068
What did you see?

245
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,948
You were flying
at I-na's dance competition.

246
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,492
In front of everyone.

247
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,037
Why?

248
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,206
No idea.

249
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,666
I can't tell what will happen.

250
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,963
You probably shouldn't
go to the show today.

251
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,964
I have to.

252
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,260
This is my chance

253
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,430
to change the future.

254
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,225
I'll go to the show,

255
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,978
and I won't fly no matter what happens.

256
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,482
If I can do that, Gwi-ju can live too.

257
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,776
Right?

258
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,290
Are we too dressed up?

259
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,542
They get extra points for their audience.

260
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,128
This is all for our granddaughter.

261
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,724
I-NA IS ALL I SEE

262
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,144
We heard the audience
affects the decision.

263
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,187
I-NA IS MY STAR

264
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,398
We'll cheer louder than anyone.

265
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,818
WAY TO GO, I-NA

266
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,825
Let's go in and grab front-row seats.

267
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
Come on.

268
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,123
Thank you.

269
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,878
Hello, sir.

270
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,172
Hey, Gwi-ju. I found the report,

271
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,841
but it can't leave the station.

272
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,175
Can you stop by?

273
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,846
I'll be right over.

274
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,306
Okay.

275
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,058
Where are you going?

276
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,603
-What about I-na?
-She won't be on for a while.

277
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,731
This is important.

278
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,110
-I'll come with you.
-You should go to I-na.

279
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,070
She must be really nervous.

280
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,741
Thanks.

281
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,209
Once, please get ready to rehearse.

282
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,547
Shall we?

283
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,631
Let's do this!

284
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,008
-Let's do this!
-We got this!

285
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,313
Ms. Da-hae.

286
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,773
See you outside.

287
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,696
I-na.

288
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,115
You look amazing.

289
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,700
Congratulations.

290
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,620
Where's Dad?

291
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,289
He had to stop by somewhere.

292
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,708
Where did he go?

293
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,753
He'll be here soon.

294
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,091
It's a bit chilly in here. Are you okay?

295
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,219
I can't tell if I'm cold or nervous.

296
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,555
Is Dad…

297
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,726
not going to make it?

298
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,188
Did something happen to him?

299
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,444
He'll be here no matter what.

300
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,863
He's been so excited about this.

301
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,495
Trust me. He'll be here.

302
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,288
Don't worry.

303
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,793
Dad told me

304
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,546
that even if it looks like the end,

305
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,005
it's not.

306
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,383
There's always a tomorrow.

307
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
I don't think the funeral without a body

308
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,597
has to be the end of the dream.

309
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,934
It just means it'll take Dad

310
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,478
a while to come back.

311
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,775
Yeah.

312
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,948
You're right.

313
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,000
You sure you're okay?

314
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,626
Yes.

315
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,837
5TH FLOOR

316
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,175
COLLAPSED

317
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,467
SAFETY CUSHION

318
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,136
The shortest route
to the fifth-floor storage…

319
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,138
POINT OF ORIGIN

320
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,808
You've been sending money
to Hyeong-jin's family, haven't you?

321
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,273
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

322
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,649
I know it was you.

323
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,027
You've been funding his son's tuition
in our team's name.

324
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,572
He grew up well.

325
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,657
Smart kid too.

326
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,410
And he has a serious appetite,
just like his dad.

327
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,132
Where are you, Gwi-ju?

328
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,226
Welcome to the National
Youth Dance Competition!

329
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,727
NATIONAL YOUTH DANCE COMPETITION

330
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,688
The contenders will compete
for the prize money

331
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,441
and the honor of being
the nation's best dance club.

332
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:31,321
I'm looking forward to the competition
among these talented teens.

333
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,407
But it's not just the dancers
competing today.

334
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,410
The audience will also take part
in a battle of their own.

335
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,831
I'm trusting our judges
to make a fair decision.

336
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,708
Without further ado,

337
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,254
let's welcome the first team
onto the stage

338
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,339
to kick off the competition.

339
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,550
They're here to show us
what waacking is all about.

340
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,303
Give it up for Viva
from Seoso Middle School!

341
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,021
Music, please.

342
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,942
I-NA, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL

343
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,652
PRIDE OF THE BOK FAMILY
I-NA THE DANCING QUEEN

344
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,320
JO JI-HAN

345
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,288
MESSAGE FROM JO JI-HAN

346
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,207
Your niece is so pretty.
She's just like you.

347
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,219
What the hell?

348
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,680
Meet me in green room number four.

349
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,534
I'm gonna kill that nutjob when I find…

350
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:08,001
We're also going to be seeing
a special performance later.

351
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:12,630
The performance group, Park Gol Box,
is here with a wire performance

352
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,842
-to support the contenders.
-Is that person not here to see you yet?

353
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,261
Please look forward to their appearance.

354
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,929
But for now, let's welcome

355
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,307
-Soul Crew to the stage!
-But it's our turn soon.

356
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,641
Music, please.

357
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,247
DANCE COMPETITION THIS WAY

358
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,444
PRIDE OF THE BOK FAMILY
BOK I-NA

359
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,988
MY DAUGHTER IS THE BEST

360
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,285
Dad.

361
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,122
"Dad"?

362
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,751
So it was your dad.

363
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,724
What the hell, Jo Ji-han?

364
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,231
GREEN ROOM 4

365
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,164
Please give them a big round of applause!

366
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,791
You're up next. Get ready.

367
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,544
Bring it in, guys.

368
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,966
That was Soul Crew with their rhythmical
and adorable performance.

369
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,926
Up next is Once from Hana Middle…

370
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,553
Hye-rim isn't coming.

371
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,640
-She'll make it.
-We don't have time.

372
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,142
The audience is waiting.

373
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,191
Who do you think they're waiting for?

374
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,944
They're all here to see me.

375
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,530
-Hye-rim.
-You made it.

376
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,615
Goh Hye-rim!

377
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,742
I knew you'd make it.

378
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,951
Couldn't you come sooner?

379
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,287
I only came because I-na begged me to.

380
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,872
There's the classic Hye-rim attitude.

381
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,207
Never thought I'd miss it.

382
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,708
I know.

383
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,960
We gotta go, guys. Hands together.

384
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,513
-We are the…
-One!

385
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,395
Surprise.

386
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,359
Come to think of it,

387
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,154
I never proposed to you properly.

388
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
-This is not happening.
-I'm for real.

389
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,618
Let's get married, Dong-hee.

390
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,789
"My dear

391
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,374
giant baby."

392
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,667
Stop it!

393
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,419
Have you lost your mind?

394
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
"Dong-hee.

395
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,422
Words can't describe the way I…"

396
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,883
Once from Hana Middle School
will now take the stage.

397
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,261
Please welcome them
with a round of applause!

398
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,105
Grandma's here!

399
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,148
WE VOUCH FOR ONCE'S PASSION

400
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,746
-Why aren't they starting?
-They're not starting.

401
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,626
The members of Once seem a little nervous.

402
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,297
Let's give them another round of applause
as a show of support.

403
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,217
Let me know when you're ready.

404
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,303
What's wrong, I-na?

405
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,973
There are so many eyes.

406
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,859
Now you can't see them.

407
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,570
But I can't dance like this.

408
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,449
Do you see me?

409
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,284
Yes, but…

410
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,785
Then you'll be fine.

411
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,456
Just keep your eyes on me.

412
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,468
We're ready.

413
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,430
Music, please.

414
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,607
-Bok I-na!
-Bok I-na!

415
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,578
-Bok I-na!
-Bok I-na!

416
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,335
-Bok I-na!
-Bok I-na!

417
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,415
-Bok I-na!
-Bok I-na!

418
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,250
-You go, girl!
-You go, girl!

419
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,003
-Bok I-na!
-Bok I-na!

420
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,103
Do you see me, Dad?

421
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,523
I have friends I can look in the eyes now.

422
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,900
I'm not invisible anymore.

423
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,569
I'm full of color now.

424
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,030
So don't worry about me.

425
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,906
I love you, Dad.

426
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,014
Guys, let's take a group photo.

427
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,932
Next team to the stage please!

428
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,975
Here we go.

429
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,062
One, two, three.

430
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,813
You closed your eyes. One more time.

431
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,232
One, two, three.

432
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,110
That's a good one. Okay.

433
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,028
Let me see.

434
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,876
Wanna get a selfie together?

435
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,671
No.

436
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,681
You can't just do things as you please.

437
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,392
You didn't like me
when I tried to please you.

438
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,316
-What did I do so wrong?
-Were you always this chatty?

439
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,819
You just can't stop talking.

440
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,323
I tried so hard to get you to like me.

441
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,409
That's what I hated.

442
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,498
You weren't the only one trying.

443
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,793
I wanted you to like me too.

444
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,378
What?

445
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,421
But you wouldn't open up to me.

446
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,715
You pretended you didn't like Jun-woo

447
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,051
and never told me he asked you out.

448
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,679
That's because you liked him.

449
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,514
I wish you'd just been honest.

450
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,308
I wanted to know
what was on your mind too.

451
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,020
We were friends.

452
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,115
Actually,

453
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,243
I have a secret.

454
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,584
I have superpowers.

455
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,712
When I look someone in the eye,

456
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,672
I hear their thoughts.

457
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,008
I have one too.

458
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,887
You do?

459
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,598
I attract attention.

460
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,768
People can't take their eyes off me.

461
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,822
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,201
You must've been really scared in the gym.

463
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,165
I'm fine now.

464
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,807
I remember this outfit.

465
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,356
When you told me
I-na was locked in the school gym,

466
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,610
this is what you were wearing.

467
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,459
I'll be right back.

468
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,221
I don't think I've seen
Dong-hee for a while.

469
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,267
Stop it!

470
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,559
-Jeez.
-Dong-hee.

471
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,853
Please, Dong-hee.

472
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,855
I'll be good to you.

473
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,650
Please give me a second chance.

474
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,151
It's all over. Let go.

475
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,487
Please, Dong-hee.

476
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,072
I said let go!

477
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
Stop it already!

478
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,163
I have another surprise.

479
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,006
Like I said,

480
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,926
Keep ignoring me,
and I'll set everything on fire.

481
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,793
Some were flailing in the air.

482
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,351
It wasn't a fire from the past.

483
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,687
What are you talking about?

484
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,286
There will be a fire.

485
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,415
-Right here, right now.
-What?

486
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:43,255
Please give them a big round of applause!

487
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,301
What's in that bottle?

488
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,261
Water?

489
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,434
Smell it if you want.

490
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
You don't think I'll do it?

491
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,025
No, I don't.

492
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,488
-What?
-I know you too well.

493
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,448
You don't have the guts.

494
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,033
You're a coward.

495
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,495
This is all for show.

496
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,497
What?

497
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,583
I'm really going to do it!

498
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,709
Go ahead.

499
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,045
I swear, I'll…

500
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,548
Hey, you want me to pour it?

501
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,300
Do you really want that?

502
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,010
You see these candles?

503
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,720
I'll pour it right on them!

504
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,180
Oh, shit!

505
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,229
You're right.

506
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,772
I can't do it.

507
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,401
I know. That's who you are.

508
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,654
That's what I liked about you.

509
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,283
What?

510
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,618
The uniqueness I loved about you

511
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,787
was your cowardice.

512
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,331
You can be a jerk,

513
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,542
but you're not heartless.

514
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,545
You're a clumsy jerk.

515
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,175
I found that cute.

516
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,844
Dong-hee.

517
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,393
Clean up the mess before you leave.

518
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,114
Gwi-ju.

519
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,533
I won't be long.

520
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,536
I'll be right back
after I tell you where I-na is.

521
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,996
Do you have to go now?

522
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,466
Why are you in such a hurry?

523
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
The rash.

524
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,433
It's fading.

525
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,191
That's why you're in a hurry.

526
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,653
We don't have much time left, do we?

527
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,452
Are you on your way to do…

528
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,288
what you have to do?

529
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,208
Da-hae.

530
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,842
So it really can't be helped.

531
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,639
This is our fate.

532
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,767
No.

533
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,229
That's not it at all.

534
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,815
I don't know how

535
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,026
or why I'll go back to that moment.

536
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,779
But one thing's for sure.

537
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,574
It's not about the rash

538
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,285
or my mother's dream.

539
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,788
If I go back to save you,

540
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,834
it'll be because I choose to.

541
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,712
Not because I have to.

542
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,381
It's my decision.

543
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,359
That being said,

544
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,528
promise me this.

545
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,823
Never regret any of the decisions
we've made.

546
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,701
Keep on making decisions.

547
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,537
You can't change the future,

548
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,247
but you can decide what comes next.

549
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,250
Fight the nightmares.

550
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,586
Please be…

551
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,672
the light in the future.

552
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,397
I'll be right back.

553
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,198
I-na's in the gym at school.

554
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,075
-We have to hurry.
-Okay.

555
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,334
Please take…

556
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,420
good care of I-na.

557
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,764
Gwi-ju.

558
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,725
Where's Gwi-ju?

559
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:48,894
He's in the past.

560
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,312
Now, of all times?

561
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,523
There will be a fire.

562
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,026
The fire from the dream
will take place here and now.

563
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,736
What?

564
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,911
I-na.

565
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,918
Why won't it come off?

566
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,437
What the hell?

567
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:32,896
Hot!

568
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,709
What's going on? Go and check that out!

569
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,047
Stop the music!

570
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,966
Don't you hear the fire alarm?

571
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,681
Move in an orderly fashion
from the back row!

572
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,391
There must be a fire. Let's get out.

573
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,018
Move slowly!

574
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,561
One at a time!

575
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,774
This is bad.

576
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,985
Will this work?

577
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,030
What do I do?

578
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,621
This is bad!

579
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,212
No, this wasn't my plan.

580
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,755
I didn't want this.

581
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,132
That's hot! I messed up.

582
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,760
Fire! There's a fire!

583
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,691
Da-hae.

584
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,613
I-na!

585
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,498
Single file!

586
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,170
There's a fire in the backstage area!

587
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,923
-Fire!
-Behind the stage!

588
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,350
Move slowly!

589
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,560
No pushing!

590
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,940
-Line up!
-Out of my way!

591
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,275
Move slowly!

592
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,527
Are you okay, Dong-hee?

593
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,611
Yeah.

594
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,697
Bring the fire curtain down!

595
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,783
-The fire curtain!
-That idiot.

596
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,333
The fire curtain got stuck.

597
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,876
It's stuck on the fog machine.

598
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,170
Fire!

599
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,717
Wait!

600
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,107
This is my decision.

601
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,152
Move slowly!

602
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,530
No pushing!

603
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,286
What is that?

604
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,290
-It's a fire shutter.
-I know that.

605
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,084
What do we do? Are we locked in?

606
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,543
Are we going to die here?

607
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,093
Wait here for a second.

608
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,263
No, don't go.
You can't leave me here all by myself.

609
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,391
We need to get out of here.

610
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,519
I'll find another way out.

611
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,938
Sit here for a moment.

612
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,482
I'll be right back.

613
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,152
I-na.

614
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,832
I-na!

615
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,669
I-na!

616
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,175
The building's on fire!

617
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,523
Are you okay?

618
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,777
You're I-na's friend, right?

619
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,695
Where's I-na?

620
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,657
She thought this was a dead end.

621
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,326
She went to find another way out.

622
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,995
To the backstage area.

623
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,789
What do I do?

624
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,082
Let's get you out of here.

625
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,841
Can you go alone?

626
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,136
Yes.

627
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,673
Dad.

628
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,800
I-na!

629
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,637
I-na!

630
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,097
Ms. Da-hae.

631
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,684
Are you okay?

632
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,979
Let's get out of here. Can you stand up?

633
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,859
Oh no.

634
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,788
Gwi-ju.

635
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:05,747
Get I-na out of here.

636
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,208
-Come with us.
-Hurry!

637
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,043
No! I'm not leaving without you.

638
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,128
Hurry!

639
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,350
A clock. It was on the school building.

640
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,853
So this is it.

641
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,147
-I was going to die here anyway.
-I-na.

642
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,149
I-na!

643
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,611
No.

644
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,989
Time's running out.

645
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,992
Gwi-ju.

646
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,870
There's a door behind you.

647
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,079
Get out of here!

648
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,126
I'm going to go save you.

649
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,545
-It's time.
-No.

650
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,381
You can't go.

651
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,801
For us to have spent
all of this time together,

652
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,345
I have to save you.

653
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,057
That's where it all begins.

654
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,736
Just go!

655
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,329
Absolutely.

656
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,582
Whenever she slams the door on me
as a teenager

657
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,000
or whenever she leaves my side

658
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,544
to hang out with her boyfriend.

659
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,005
Guess you'll be back all the time.

660
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,842
All the time.

661
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,929
No matter how much time passes,

662
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,391
I'll never let go

663
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,560
of the moment you came to me, I-na.

664
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,064
I-na.

665
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,441
You're so pretty.

666
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,035
Thank you.

667
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,998
For bringing I-na to us.

668
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,668
For giving me this moment.

669
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,966
You're a sweetie.

670
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,134
Thank you so much.

671
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,150
Are you happy Daddy's here, I-na?

672
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,781
I-na, it's your daddy.

673
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,617
You're with your daddy.

674
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,994
She's talking.

675
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,832
Are you happy? You're so sweet.

676
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,542
She's sleepy.

677
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,364
Sir, there's someone
in the fifth-floor storage.

678
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,157
Fifth-floor storage?

679
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,992
-EMT!
-Yes.

680
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,828
Please get everyone out of here.

681
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,334
Hyeong-jin!

682
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,633
Let's go already!

683
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,719
Hyeong-jin! No!

684
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,329
After the entrance collapsed,

685
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,415
it only took a couple of minutes
until the lab exploded.

686
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,751
I have to create a shortcut.

687
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,923
Da-hae.

688
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:37,675
Da-hae.

689
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,979
Breathe.

690
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,399
Breathe.

691
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,359
Good.

692
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,444
Keep breathing, Da-hae.

693
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,238
Keep breathing.

694
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,449
You have to breathe.

695
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,950
That's it.

696
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,415
Let's go.

697
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,630
Come on.

698
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,821
You have to jump.

699
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:06,866
Alone?

700
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,787
No, not alone.

701
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,832
I'll be with you.

702
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,045
Even when you think you're all alone.

703
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,049
And it won't just be me.

704
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,469
You'll meet everyone soon.

705
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,807
Things won't always be easy,

706
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,643
but when you look back,

707
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,854
you'll see that every moment
we spent together…

708
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:40,900
was happiness.

709
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,001
Don't lose this until then.

710
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,089
Please hold on to it.

711
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,777
Remember.

712
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,410
This isn't the end.

713
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,089
It's the beginning.

714
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,351
It may seem like the end,

715
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,645
but it's far from it.

716
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,401
There's always a tomorrow.

717
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,307
No one got hurt that day.

718
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,644
There was just one missing person.

719
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,534
This is not the end.

720
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,830
And I'm not alone.

721
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,224
Bok Nu-ri.

722
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,477
What did I tell you?

723
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:08,232
You owe me 100 kisses
for playing with the ball in the room.

724
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,859
I'm gonna get you.

725
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,111
I'm gonna get you, Nu-ri.

726
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,363
I'm coming for you.

727
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,992
I got you!

728
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,201
So?

729
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,538
Are you going to give me
100 kisses or not?

730
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,373
-I am.
-Go ahead.

731
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,542
I want 100 kisses.

732
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,127
We're still waiting

733
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,421
for our tomorrow.

734
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,795
Did you have yourself a nice flight?

735
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,967
Look at him.

736
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,636
Why does he get to go?

737
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,431
I wanna ride.

738
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,183
I'm not a rollercoaster.

739
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,730
Hey, what's Nu-ri's superpower?

740
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:32,817
We don't know yet.

741
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,569
I hope he can duplicate things.

742
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:40,699
He could turn 50,000 won
into 500 million won.

743
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,788
You're so consistent.

744
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,457
Always a freeloader.

745
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,209
Come on.

746
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,545
It's not that easy
to turn over a new leaf.

747
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,006
I failed another audition.

748
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,137
Keep at it, okay?

749
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,561
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

750
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,360
Here you go.

751
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,946
If you had any good dreams,
tell me about them.

752
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,907
You gave me the heads-up
about our boiler breaking last time.

753
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,785
I think…

754
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,623
we'll be having a special guest today.

755
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,467
I-na! Bok I-na!

756
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,303
Wait for me.

757
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,638
What should we eat today?

758
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,515
You're back.

759
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,185
What's that?

760
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,896
I brought some seaweed soup
from the sauna.

761
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,733
I-na is coming home from the dorm today.

762
01:09:56,317 --> 01:10:01,071
I made my famous braised pollock,
given the occasion.

763
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,158
-I'll heat this up.
-Please.

764
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,880
We'll need another set of cutlery.

765
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,592
Is someone else coming?

766
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:26,430
I don't know,
but I saw another set in my dream.

767
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,228
Okay.

768
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,399
You found the ball.

769
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,864
You cried about losing it
all day yesterday.

770
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:48,160
I couldn't find it anywhere.

771
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,411
Where was it?

772
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,622
I found it in yesterday.

773
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,669
-Yesterday?
-I brought it from yesterday.

774
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,424
Can you bring things

775
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,177
back from the past?

776
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,554
What's a "past"?

777
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:09,306
Yesterday, for example.

778
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,810
Should I bring you something too?

779
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,442
I lost something long ago.

780
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,197
Do you think you can bring it back for me?

781
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,824
How long ago?

782
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,909
Yesterday's yesterday's yesterday?

783
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,454
No, it was way before that.

784
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,375
It was

785
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,087
about five years ago.

786
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,214
No.

787
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,466
Was it 18 years ago?

788
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,886
What does it look like?

789
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,223
Just a second.

790
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,363
Daddy?

791
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,198
Yes.

792
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,454
Can you

793
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,915
bring Daddy back?

794
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,704
I'll be right back.

795
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,058
Welcome back.

796
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,911
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY
