1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,870
Surprise!

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,760
Grandma!

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,150
Hello, young man.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,160
I’m a boxer.

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,500
So, he’s the reason you became interested in watching boxing.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,550
I heard that Dr. Ter has actively met with numerous media reps and KOLs.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,370
Can we really outvote them?

8
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,860
You just continue doing what you do, Doc.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,610
- Leave the rest to me and my friends. - We’re here, Doc!

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,330
Yak is fortunate to have you as his doctor.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,940
Thank you, Yak, for today.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,230
Actually, you have really sweet eyes, you know?

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,560
Oh come on, Yak.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,250
Why'd you open the curtain?

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,500
It's my day off today.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,700
Get up.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,110
I’m making breakfast for you.

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,020
Not hungry.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,200
You go ahead.

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,300
Nope.

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,870
I have to be at a training camp out of town all week,

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,210
so we won't see each other for several days.

23
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,300
Alright, I’m up.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,300
Let me go brush my teeth first.

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,900
Hurry up, okay?

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,710
Now get up.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,660
Gosh, Yoryak!

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,420
Why did you make such a mess while brushing your teeth?

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,100
It's a masterpiece. Isn't it pretty?

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,010
What a masterpiece!

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,910
Van Gogh's Starry Night doesn't even come close.

32
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,810
Wow, this looks yummy.

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,200
Let’s eat!

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,210
I’m diving in.

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Let’s see how good your cooking skills are.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,050
Whoa, delicious.

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,850
Really?

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,930
Why do you have to train so far away?

39
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,110
Probably,

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,600
Yei uses this as an indirect way to keep me from seeing you.

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,940
I don’t think I’m the reason.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,200
I heard you're always waiting for Taemrak, the cool girl.

43
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,250
Not true!

44
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,500
Taem's been super busy with Student Council stuff.

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,100
I see you more often than I see her.

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,360
I reckon Yei wants his friend over there to fix my weak spots.

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,960
Yoryak Phadetseuk has weak spots too?

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,400
Yes, I do.

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,610
The first match I lost,

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,070
I was still hung up on it.

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,710
Not because I couldn't read the opponent's gameplay.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,700
Then, what was the cause of your defeat?

53
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,310
I was drained.

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,800
I had been winning by TKO,

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,400
so I never had to go the full rounds before.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,210
In that fight, I suddenly ran out of energy.

57
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,920
My arms and legs felt too heavy to move,

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,020
and before I knew it,

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,210
the opponent kept throwing punches at me until I blacked out.

60
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,610
I didn't realize before

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,100
that running out of energy could be a boxer's weak spot.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,100
Yes, the one who runs out of energy first is likely to be defeated.

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,950
But this time,

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,300
I won’t be the one who runs out of energy before my opponent.

65
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,700
Here’s to Mr. Yoryak,

66
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,880
the fighter who will become stronger, tougher,

67
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,110
10 times more stamina, enduring and lasting!

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
Are you talking about boxing–

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,970
strong, tough, stamina, enduring…

70
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,900
Yes, boxing.

71
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,350
Come on.

72
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Cheers.

73
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,740
But I don’t want to leave just yet.

74
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,570
Why?

75
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,800
You're scared you'll miss me too much, aren't you?

76
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,410
Me?

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,410
How about a bet?

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,160
Who will be the first to show they miss the other?

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,600
Let’s do it.

80
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,970
10 drinks on the bet.

81
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,700
Deal.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,510
Yak, how’s your training going?

83
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,800
The match is near,

84
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,510
Yei has me doing his intensive training program–

85
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,540
10 km of running in the morning,

86
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,900
followed by strength training for my arms and legs.

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,280
After that, I have to get some rest to regain energy

88
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,340
for more training in the afternoon and evening.

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,300
Wow, you’re so disciplined with your program.

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,660
It's been tough going for me too.

91
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,200
I have to do rounds,

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,360
and my patient cases are getting more difficult.

93
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,200
Plus, I have to find time to study for my research.

94
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,160
Don’t overdo it.

95
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,420
Make sure to take breaks too.

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
I know.

97
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,100
What’s your plan for this afternoon?

98
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,100
I have some warmups

99
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,410
and then I’ll be in the ring

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,970
practicing my gameplay and punching strategies.

101
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,960
What about you?

102
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,780
I have to prepare for surgeries on my patients

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,970
and team meetings.

104
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,970
Everything must be flawless with no mistakes.

105
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,670
I’ll give it my all.

106
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,010
Same here.

107
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,010
I’m going to win that world champion title no matter what.

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,300
And I’m going to secure that scholarship.

109
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,900
Both of us,

110
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,210
keep fighting!

111
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,020
You seem to be gaining more strength.

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,200
Is it good enough for the champion title?

113
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,960
Do you think the training you're doing here every day,

114
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,600
Mason, the current world champion, is doing the same training too?

115
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,510
No. He must be training harder than me.

116
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,710
Exactly.

117
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,920
Where are you going?

118
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,800
Got enough rest?

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Back to training.

120
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,240
But you've been training for extended hours already.

121
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,580
It’s alright. I’m fine.

122
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,410
Come on.

123
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,980
Okay.

124
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,030
Go.

125
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,800
Good.

126
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,860
You sure you’re okay?

127
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,590
No sweat.

128
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,510
What’s this pattern on your pants? It’s cute.

129
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,560
Elephant with boxing gloves?

130
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,400
That's my own design, you know?

131
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,300
Do you like it?

132
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,810
Yes, it’s cute.

133
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:19,074
(Wandee: How’s training going?)

134
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:23,299
(Yoryak: It’s OK, I need to sleep now, I have another training in the afternoon.)

135
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:26,123
(Wandee: OK, rest well, Yak.)

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Grueling training, huh?

137
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,790
You've been out of touch for so long.

138
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,940
Feeling lonely, right, Gooddy?

139
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,910
Yak has only been gone for three days.

140
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Is it unbearable now without him?

141
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,410
“What? I’m not lonely.”

142
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,310
“I’m fine by myself.”

143
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,100
“Before Yak came along, I was living all on my own, right?”

144
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,470
I don’t know, Yei.

145
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,200
I feel relaxed,

146
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,920
and I feel like I can be myself completely around Dr. Dee and Taem.

147
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,660
Who’s the first person who pops into your head then?

148
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,320
What?

149
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,300
Like, if you close your eyes, who do you see first?

150
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,830
The person who comes to mind first–

151
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,570
That’s the one holding the most significance in your heart.

152
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,700
Now, close your eyes.

153
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,060
Yei, what are you doing?

154
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,020
Just trying to start a conversation to help you relax.

155
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,310
You trained so hard all day.

156
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,750
Alright, I’m turning in.

157
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,710
Don’t stay up too late.

158
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,610
(Chat: Taemrak / Wandee)

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:47,290
(Wandee: Don’t go to bed yet. Wait a moment.)

160
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,330
(Yoryak: What’s up, Doc? Are you calling me?)

161
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,300
(Who’s the first person who pops into your head then.)

162
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,150
(Like, if you close your eyes, who do you see first?)

163
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,420
Yak.

164
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,970
Doc.

165
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,750
I’m glad

166
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,310
you haven’t gone to bed yet.

167
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,500
What brings you here?

168
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,780
Well…

169
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,820
I brought you this medication.

170
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,160
Is that so?

171
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,570
If your pain gets worse without it,

172
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,150
you'll call me to check on you anyway.

173
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,270
Take it.

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,150
If you miss me,

175
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,410
you can just say "I miss you."

176
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,670
Who misses you? You're mistaken.

177
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,580
Thanks.

178
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,910
The atmosphere here is great.

179
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,850
It got even better with you here.

180
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,460
Have you been missing me?

181
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,660
There you go.

182
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
You just admitted you miss me first.

183
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,320
What?

184
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,710
You just said it got better with me here.

185
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
That practically means you miss me.

186
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,300
That’s a nervous laughter.

187
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,910
Do you even realize you just confessed that you miss me?

188
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,360
When did I confess that?

189
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,470
Give me a break.

190
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,670
You said, “You miss me first."

191
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,130
That implies you're missing me.

192
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,690
No,

193
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,100
I just pretended to say that to make you happy.

194
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,180
So? Are you happy?

195
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
You big baby.

196
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,300
You fell for that so easily.

197
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,350
What’re you doing, Yak?

198
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,520
I’m recharging my power.

199
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,610
Tonight,

200
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,010
can you stay here with me?

201
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,450
I can’t.

202
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,880
I’m heading back soon.

203
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,070
I've got an early start at work tomorrow.

204
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,760
What?

205
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,600
Why?

206
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,410
You drove almost two hours to get here.

207
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,910
Can’t you stay?

208
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,710
I really can’t.

209
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,410
You also have intensive training tomorrow morning, don’t you?

210
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,080
If you don’t have the energy for it, Oyei will scold you.

211
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,970
I’m leaving.

212
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,760
Wait.

213
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,900
Let me store up power charges for the future.

214
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,160
Yak!

215
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,860
Your turn.

216
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,830
Give me a kiss.

217
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,210
No.

218
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,010
Come on.

219
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,290
Just one kiss is fine.

220
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,000
Alright.

221
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,600
Where do you want to be kissed?

222
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,900
No.

223
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,980
Well then…

224
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,680
Right here’s good.

225
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,740
Yoryak!

226
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,650
Seminar in Japan?

227
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,500
The board would like you two to present our hospital’s research there.

228
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,360
Which research?

229
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,110
Is it the one Dee and I are currently working on?

230
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,710
No.

231
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,640
The board likes the research you both collaborated on last year.

232
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,610
But that one…

233
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,920
Ah, that research.

234
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,420
No problem, sir.

235
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,070
Dee and I will revisit it and make any necessary updates.

236
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,810
The board would like to see if both of you can work together as a team or not.

237
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,300
You can count on us.

238
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,010
Dee and I won’t disappoint you or the board.

239
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,260
Dr. Ter.

240
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,900
Dr. Ter, wait up.

241
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,710
Dr. Ter!

242
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,830
I haven’t agreed to that yet.

243
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,000
But you didn’t refuse Dr. Apichart either.

244
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
I didn’t get a chance to.

245
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,170
You made all the decisions on your own.

246
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,340
If I hadn't, you wouldn’t have had time to talk with me.

247
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,310
What do you mean?

248
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,710
Never mind.

249
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,110
What’s up with you?

250
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,970
I’ll send you the date and time to work on this together.

251
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,650
The important thing is,

252
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,610
we must maintain the good name of our hospital.

253
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,410
Understood?

254
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,870
Dr. Ter!

255
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,150
I don’t get it at all.

256
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,220
All of a sudden, Dr. Ter became bossy

257
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,980
and said he would give me the date and time to talk about this task.

258
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,510
Seriously, since when did I become his direct report?

259
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,710
That’s really strange of him.

260
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,600
Sure is.

261
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,500
He and I are now competitors.

262
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,030
We are on the same level.

263
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,500
Did he get it wrong?

264
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,970
Who else is going with you two to this seminar?

265
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,000
Just Dr. Ter and I.

266
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,020
What? You gotta be kidding.

267
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,660
Did you book two rooms?

268
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,560
The hospital only provides a budget for one hotel room.

269
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,210
Shit. What about the bed?

270
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,550
Two beds or one bed?

271
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,550
Damn.

272
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,820
Two beds!

273
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,150
You scared the hell out of me, Kao.

274
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,710
You had me so nervous for a second.

275
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,890
But this is not good.

276
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,410
You’re going to a romantic city with Dr. Ter.

277
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,410
So what?

278
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,470
Hey, Dee.

279
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,500
When you visit a city that is very romantic,

280
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,340
it does something to your heart.

281
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,710
It can make you fall in love more easily.

282
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,170
Picture this.

283
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,350
You spend time with Dr. Ter alone.

284
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,600
A soft light and gentle breeze.

285
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,290
You are in your unusual outfits.

286
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,910
Dee.

287
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,410
You unintentionally lock eyes with him.

288
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,480
A special moment occurs.

289
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,460
There’s a spark between you two.

290
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,600
I’ll stop being in denial.

291
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,800
I love you, Dee.

292
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,310
Stop!

293
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,370
You’re making me visualize it.

294
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,220
And stop spinning around me; it makes me dizzy.

295
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,970
Dee,

296
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,100
scientifically speaking,

297
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,610
public space has a significant impact on how people fall in love.

298
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,700
I don’t care.

299
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,100
I’m going there for a seminar.

300
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,650
I’ll only stay within the hotel premises.

301
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,020
All I see is squares–

302
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,040
hotel walls, projectors,

303
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,090
proceedings papers.

304
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,220
There won’t be anything romantic for sure, my friend.

305
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,510
You sure?

306
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,490
I’m sure.

307
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,090
I no longer have feelings for Dr. Ter.

308
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,980
Okay.

309
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,360
Come on. Keep going.

310
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,610
Be strong.

311
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,460
Put more force.

312
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,370
There you go.

313
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,830
Don’t stop.

314
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,100
Be strong.

315
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,000
Wow, the owner’s sweetheart is very tough.

316
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,160
I’m hungry. Anything to eat?

317
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,050
I’ve prepared your and Yak’s favorite dishes.

318
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,510
Have a cheat day for one day, okay?

319
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,460
Sorry, Cher.

320
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,760
I need to go somewhere.

321
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,760
Let’s eat together tomorrow.

322
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,200
Jo,

323
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
put this in my room for me.

324
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,360
Sure.

325
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,980
Yak, you just got home. You’re going out again?

326
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,780
Yak.

327
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,800
-Yei.
- Yak!

328
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,060
What is it?

329
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,560
Tokyo Tower.

330
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,820
After the seminar, I want to ask you to come with me.

331
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,120
I want to go to the location of the film Tokyo Tower.

332
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,810
(When you visit a city that is very romantic,

333
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
it does something to your heart.)

334
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,040
(It can make you fall in love more easily.)

335
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,710
(A soft light.)

336
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,970
(You unintentionally lock eyes with him.)

337
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,000
(A special moment occurs.)

338
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,110
(There’s a spark between you two.)

339
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,420
I better not.

340
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,050
I want to go back right after the seminar concludes.

341
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,160
But I've already pushed back our flights for another two days.

342
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,720
That would be a waste.

343
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,260
It's been a while since we've had any time off.

344
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,900
Can’t you stay with me there for two more days?

345
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,750
But…

346
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,840
But…

347
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,400
I want to spend time with you.

348
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,400
Can I?

349
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,400
Just the two of us.

350
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,210
I have to go get an HPV vaccine now.

351
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,840
Please excuse me.

352
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,920
Not only do females need this vaccine,

353
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,620
but males and any individuals beyond the binary can also get it.

354
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,260
At the age of 9 years old,

355
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,800
two shots are required with a 6-12 month interval.

356
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
For those 15 years old and above, three shots are required,

357
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,090
with a 1-2 month interval.

358
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,970
Right now, we have vaccines to prevent HPV available.

359
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,910
I recommend getting one as early as possible.

360
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,960
Then I’d like to book this vaccine for my daughter.

361
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,700
Sure, ma’am.

362
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,700
Hi, Dr. Wandee.

363
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,900
You’re here for your vaccine?

364
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,450
This way, please.

365
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,310
Here we go.

366
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,100
There might be some mild effects like muscle pain and swelling.

367
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,760
But they will go away, just like other vaccine injections.

368
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,200
Got it.

369
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,900
(I want to go to the location of the film Tokyo Tower.)

370
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,300
I love you, Dee.

371
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,200
It’s done, sir.

372
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,700
You can schedule the second shot with the nurse outside.

373
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,870
Alright. Thank you.

374
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,530
(Yoryak: On my way there. See you.)

375
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,160
Yak.

376
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,340
Easy there.

377
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,970
Gosh, my mind is always here.

378
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,010
What was that for?

379
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,310
Well, I miss…

380
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,900
I miss this hospital.

381
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,310
You sure?

382
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,710
Why do you miss my workplace though?

383
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,770
Is there any rule that bars me from missing the hospital?

384
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,300
Huh? Is there?

385
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,220
Gosh, I miss this hospital so much.

386
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,750
Still texting?

387
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,310
Just finished.

388
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,980
I was planning to meet Taem at a café,

389
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,970
but when she found out I was here,

390
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,700
she said she was nearby and decided to come over.

391
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,040
I see.

392
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,780
I’m all yours now.

393
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,080
Feel free to examine.

394
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,310
My body is all yours.

395
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,860
Oh.

396
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,210
Sorry, Doc.

397
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,800
You’re a patient.

398
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,560
Though his body is yours.

399
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,430
What about his heart?

400
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,700
Does it also belong to you?

401
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,490
We are just fake boyfriends.

402
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,670
His heart doesn't belong to me.

403
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,750
So why don’t you go back to Dr. Ter, your first love?

404
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,410
Get out.

405
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,300
Don’t you remember what he said to me?

406
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,200
He doesn’t have feelings for me.

407
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,800
He only sees me as his brother.

408
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,050
I think Dr. Ter realizes how he feels about you now.

409
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,810
Let him. I don’t care.

410
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,380
If you really didn’t care,

411
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,600
you wouldn’t have asked Yoryak to be your fake boyfriend.

412
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,450
I just…

413
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,980
You need to choose now

414
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,160
who you really have feelings for.

415
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,270
There's still time

416
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,700
before everything becomes too complicated for you to back out.

417
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,050
Well, I have cases to take care of.

418
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,110
I need to get going.

419
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,810
After you got close to Dr. Wandee,

420
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,750
you seem to come to the hospital quite often.

421
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,510
Yes. He takes good care of me.

422
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,560
He also became your student at the gym.

423
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,100
Hey. What are you getting at?

424
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,910
Yak, can I ask you something?

425
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,660
I’m actually quite open.

426
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,810
I just want to ask.

427
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,050
You may refuse to answer if you’re not okay with it.

428
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,670
Sure.

429
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,750
You can ask.

430
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,400
What’s the deal with you and Dr. Wandee?

431
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Well, he and I are…

432
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,500
Yak is my case study.

433
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:24,700
I’m doing research on supporting boxers, so I asked Yak to help me.

434
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,100
Now it makes sense why you two have become close.

435
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Yes.

436
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,750
It took me quite some time before he agreed to help me.

437
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,010
Right?

438
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:42,220
Yes. He even bought six courses at my gym in one payment.

439
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,040
Awesome, Doctor.

440
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,700
How long will it take to finish your research?

441
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,000
Actually, it should take around four months.

442
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,980
But I started it quite a while ago... around...

443
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,600
A bit over a month, I think.

444
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,900
So, it’s less than three months to go.

445
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,360
Right?

446
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,810
Naughty hand.

447
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,800
Can’t help it.

448
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,520
We were apart for a while.

449
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,610
Don’t you miss me?

450
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,130
I do.

451
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,500
Dr. Dee came to see Yak there.

452
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,300
But no one came for me.

453
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,100
I have to be here for the gym.

454
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,360
Who would take care of our customers, if I went there?

455
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,060
Wasn’t our video call enough?

456
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,530
I still couldn’t shake off what I saw.

457
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,770
Why don’t you see the real thing then?

458
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,040
When I saw Yak looking concerned about Taemrak

459
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,000
when she asked about our relationship,

460
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,810
I felt guilty for some reason.

461
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,500
Why so?

462
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,410
Well…

463
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,300
It’s like I’m using someone else’s boyfriend.

464
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,400
Now, you’re playing a guilty card.

465
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,770
I really 	do feel guilty.

466
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,620
Then stop.

467
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,760
Stop before it’s too late.

468
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,600
But…

469
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,530
You can’t stop.

470
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,900
Kao,

471
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,300
why do I feel such an overwhelming sense of guilt?

472
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,060
Maybe you already love Yak.

473
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,120
Me? Loving Yak?

474
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,760
I still can’t shake off this hurtful feeling from Dr. Ter.

475
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,970
How could I have feelings for anyone?

476
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,510
Then prove it.

477
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,520
Prove how you really feel about Yoryak.

478
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,650
Where’s the costume?

479
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,260
What roles are we taking tonight?

480
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,730
Yak,

481
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,210
let’s go hang out together

482
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,360
and just be ourselves.

483
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,400
Let’s take a selfie.

484
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,260
Lean in a bit more to be in the frame.

485
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,500
1, 2, 3.

486
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:08,606
Yak!

487
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,900
Doctor.

488
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,320
Hello.

489
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,720
Excuse me. Could you please take a picture for us?

490
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,760
Sorry to bother you.

491
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,910
Oh, could you also remove the lens cap?

492
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,700
Yak wanted Yei and me to go out and about too.

493
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,700
He noticed some tension between Yei and me.

494
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,880
It feels great, doesn’t it?

495
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,950
I thought going out like this wouldn’t be fun,

496
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,760
but with more people,

497
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,300
it's much more enjoyable than I thought.

498
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,300
I agree.

499
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,610
It seems like Yak introduced you to become a part of the Phadetseuk family.

500
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,400
Nah. I don’t think so.

501
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,760
Have we kept you waiting too long?

502
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,330
Cher.

503
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,700
Thanks.

504
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,580
Here you go.

505
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,210
Thanks.

506
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,550
I also got this for you.

507
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,320
Try it on.

508
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,460
- You can’t be serious. - I’m serious. Try it.

509
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,270
It fits perfectly.

510
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,850
It’s cute too.

511
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,120
Seriously?

512
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,750
Ask Yak then.

513
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,410
Yes.

514
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,970
It’s pretty cute.

515
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,600
So, let’s split here.

516
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,250
Yes. See you.

517
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,330
This tastes good.

518
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:43,416
Yes, it's good after not having it for a long while.

519
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,800
Anything else you want to eat?

520
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,050
What do you want to eat?

521
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,810
I want another sweet treat. Then I’m done.

522
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,010
Right there?

523
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,560
Yes.

524
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,600
Hey, let’s talk about the debt you owe.

525
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,350
Can you give me more time?

526
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,710
No, too many extensions already.

527
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,110
Hold up, Cher.

528
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,800
I changed my mind.

529
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,970
Let’s go to that place over there instead.

530
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,350
What?

531
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,400
Let’s go to the shop on that side.

532
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,730
Change of plans.

533
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,010
Don’t you want to eat that anymore?

534
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,310
No. Hurry. Let’s go there before it’s closed.

535
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,750
Yei sent us pictures.

536
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,100
How come I look like that?

537
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,520
Yes, you look so tense.

538
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,470
But you look good in this one.

539
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,110
I’m quite handsome there, eh?

540
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,910
This is great.

541
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,310
What is great?

542
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,670
It looks like a family photo.

543
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,200
With you and Cher there,

544
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,170
I can’t help but think of the picture Oyei and I had with our mom and dad.

545
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,910
Let me see more.

546
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,770
This one is great too.

547
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,210
Wow. So this is the place you wanted to take me to.

548
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,980
Yes.

549
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,740
You couldn't tell from the outside

550
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,460
that it would be this nice up here, right?

551
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,910
I could never have imagined this.

552
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,500
A secret bar in a big city, Yoryak’s safe zone.

553
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,110
Yes. It’s a secret.

554
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,300
Promise me first.

555
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,210
What?

556
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,870
Promise me that you'll keep this place a secret.

557
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,440
You must not tell anyone ever.

558
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,620
It’s that serious?

559
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,910
Yes, dead serious.

560
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,710
This isn't fair.

561
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,410
I didn’t even want to be here.

562
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,850
You dragged me.

563
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,670
And you know how chatty I am.

564
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,850
What if I accidentally let slip about this place?

565
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,600
What if people find out? What do I do?

566
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,410
But...

567
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,010
Stop.

568
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
One more word and I’ll kiss you.

569
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,840
This time it will be on the lips,

570
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,460
not the necklace.

571
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,210
Why stop?

572
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,970
Wait for me here a bit, I’ll be back soon.

573
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,230
Where are you going?

574
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,970
I’ll be back before you know it.

575
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,700
Don’t go anywhere else. Okay?

576
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:00,510
Cher.

577
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,200
Who are these for?

578
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,420
For you, of course.

579
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,610
For me?

580
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,410
Yes.

581
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,020
But it's not a special occasion today.

582
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,710
It is special.

583
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,300
Just having you by my side makes every day special to me.

584
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,340
Yei.

585
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,210
Come on.

586
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,210
If I've ever done anything to upset you,

587
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,710
I apologize.

588
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,750
Don't be mad at me.

589
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,900
If you go to this length,

590
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,810
who could be mad at you, you crazy man?

591
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,600
How come people say Bangkok isn't a romantic city?

592
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,410
What was that?

593
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,360
Nothing, just something that crossed my mind.

594
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,910
People say Bangkok is a city of struggle.

595
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,630
a sphere of endurance,

596
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,810
a city where we need to be cautious about everything.

597
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,210
That makes it hard for people to fall in love here.

598
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,100
Is it really that bad?

599
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,010
It's just a theory.

600
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,910
It depends on the individual.

601
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,660
Romantic notions vary from person to person.

602
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:03,970
Some might find a trash pile in front of a convenience store romantic,

603
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:10,420
while others might think a sports field is super romantic.

604
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,410
Is that so?

605
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,920
I never knew a boxer had this romantic side.

606
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,050
The tough side is for when I step into the ring,

607
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,290
Unchanging love is Yoryak Phadetsuek’s everything.

608
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,810
You want that to become a meme?

609
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,910
Get out.

610
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:29,970
Don’t you find that cute?

611
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,300
It is kinda cute.

612
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,300
Yei.

613
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,820
Hm?

614
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:51,010
If you hadn't passed by when I was being assaulted,

615
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,560
we wouldn’t have met.

616
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,730
And you wouldn’t have become my first client at the gym.

617
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,670
And you wouldn’t have become the manager of my gym.

618
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,980
And... I wouldn’t have become your sweetheart.

619
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,100
I’m sorry if I turned out to be a sucky boyfriend.

620
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,910
Why apologize?

621
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,560
You’re fine.

622
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,910
I like the way you are now.

623
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,410
Thank you.

624
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,410
Let’s have a race.

625
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,600
What?

626
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,860
Come on. Let’s go.

627
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:40,730
Yak!

628
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,570
Move.

629
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,510
Oi.

630
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:56,450
(How’s your feeling validation going? So how do you really feel about him?)

631
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,300
What are you waiting for?

632
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:23,600
Come on. Hurry up.

633
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,200
(I’m not sure how I feel about Yak.)

634
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,500
(All I know is that…)

635
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,100
(Yak is the only person who can make me feel at ease.)

636
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,200
(Kao…)

637
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,610
(I think Bangkok tonight is more romantic than any other night.)

638
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,700
(Don’t you agree?)

639
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,800
Dating with Yak–did you give him your kiss?

640
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,090
I’m still not sure.

641
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,980
If you say you don’t care and have no feelings left,

642
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,310
do you still keep that person’s stuff?

643
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,100
I know Dee better than you do.

644
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,100
Are you sure? That’s not just in your head.

645
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,140
If I win this fight, can I have you back?

646
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,740
What do you want?

647
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,910
Give me your first kiss if I win.
