1
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,880
Last night

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,860
I saw Wish. He was in the music room with that dude

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,460
That dude?

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,000
That dude?

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,980
Noh?

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,440
Yes!

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,540
I don’t know what they were doing

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,860
Was there something going between them?

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,200
Wait

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,260
I asked Sorn

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,280
He said he went to teach Noh English

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
He went with Wish

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,980
So that I won’t be worried

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,160
I though Noh is flirting with Sorn

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,000
No

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,460
Noh is flirting with Wish

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,600
You’re wrong

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,900
You’re wrong the one

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,980
I think you’re wrong!

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,560
You’re wrong!

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,260
Fine. I’m wrong

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,100
So that means Noh is flirting with Wish not Sorn

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,420
I don’t have to be worried anymore

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,340
Shit

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,000
Is it real?

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,280
I think

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,000
You have to calm down first

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,500
Maybe there’s nothing to worry about at all

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,520
Also

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,000
Noh already has a boyfriend

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,800
Even though he has one

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,420
Doesn’t mean he cannot have more

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,980
Look

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,000
He doesn’t set his status as in a relationship

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,420
I’m sure

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,000
Most of the couples don’t do that

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,800
You’re right

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,200
Here

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,980
It’s obvious they’re together

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
You’re right

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,080
But how can you be sure?

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,980
Maybe you just imagine it

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,420
This is Phun

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,500
You’re right

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Maybe it’s real

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,980
Of course

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
Faculty of Economics

48
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,440
But he’s not from our university

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
Yeah

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
I’m free this afternoon

51
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,980
I will go to ask him

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,260
Okay?

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,980
I’m coming with you

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,800
You can wait here

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,340
I’ll go there by myself

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to reconcile with Wish first

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
Should I go now?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,440
But he told me to wait here

59
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,060
How can I go to reconcile with Wish if I wait here?

60
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,000
Is Wish coming here?

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,660
Is he coming?

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,360
I’m off

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,500
See you

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,980
Phun

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,580
Hey

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,820
Pin

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you doing here?

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you free?

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,980
I have something to talk to you

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,980
Actually, I’m not free

71
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,440
If you have something to say just make it quick

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,000
You and Noh are together, right?

73
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Why?

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,980
I’m just curious. What’s going on between your boyfriend and my boyfriend?

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
We should talk about this

77
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,020
Thank you

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,960
I…

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,720
I’m worried that he will have someone else

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,800
We were always together before

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,780
But now

82
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,460
He doesn’t have any time for me

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,980
He’s hiding away from me

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,240
Can I ask you?

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,580
If you’re in my shoe, what will you do?

86
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,060
If it’s me

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,720
About having no time for each other

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
It’s usually me who do that

89
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,340
As you can see

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
I talked about this with Noh

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,980
He understands me

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
But…

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,080
You guys are in different university, right?

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
You’re right

95
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,740
You and Sorn are also in different faculty, right?

96
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,480
Yes

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,480
But we’re still in the same university

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,180
I can still see him

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,980
Do you feel that you guys are far apart?

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
So far

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,380
It’s because

102
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,820
You guys don’t trust each other

103
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,840
Even if you guys are near each other

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,800
But your feelings are not

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,520
If both of you trust each other

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,020
Even you guys study in different faculty

107
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,520
You won’t feel that the distance can affect your relationship

108
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,380
Don’t be stressed

109
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,520
Just chill

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,980
Yes, chill…

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,900
Hey

112
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,820
Hey, Noh

113
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,040
Phum is not with you guys?

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,800
No. He just got separated. You’re too late

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,820
Well

116
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,360
Can you give these to him?

117
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,140
You can give it to himself. He’s in that café

118
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,400
I think you can still find him there

119
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,020
See you guys later then. Thank you

120
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,400
See you

121
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,000
(You don’t have to come today. I’ve got a tight schedule)

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
Who the hell is here?

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,980
It’s so late already

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,980
What the hell are you doing here?

125
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
You’re so annoying

126
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,700
I’m sorry

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,400
You never care about my feeling

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,980
Did you know that?

129
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,320
I know

130
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,000
If you know then why did you still do it?

131
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,900
What you did…

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,560
Do you know that it makes me sad?

133
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,940
Just go back

134
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,260
I don’t want to see your face

135
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,760
Wait!

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,740
What?

137
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,440
Listen to me first

138
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,420
I will do everything

139
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,740
Huh?

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,240
You…

141
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,720
You can tell me to do anything

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,980
I will do everything to make you forgive me

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
I won’t forgive you

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,220
A person like you

145
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,980
You’re all talk!

146
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,980
Watch me

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,460
Stay right here until I forgive you then

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,500
Fine

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Just wait and see

150
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,720
Are you crazy?

151
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,460
Get up

152
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,520
You told me stay like this until you forgive me

153
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,660
Then I order you to get up

154
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,740
I won’t

155
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,380
This is my order

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,700
Get up!

157
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you okay?

158
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,740
Are you crazy?

159
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,420
If I tell you to kill yourself, are you going to do it?

160
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,460
I won’t

161
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,340
I will be here

162
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,720
I will stay right here

163
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,920
Until you forgive me

164
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,580
Go back

165
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,460
No

166
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,980
I’m ordering you to go back

167
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,460
Okay…

168
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,020
Come here at 7am

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Buy me a porridge

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,480
The vendor on the main street

171
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,460
Stop right there

172
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,280
Don’t forget to buy steamed bun, deep-fried dough stick, and soy milk

173
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,080
Add basil seeds. Less sweet

174
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,180
The vendor is two lanes next to where you buy the porridge

175
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,340
Do you understand?

176
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,980
Yes, sir!

177
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
See you tomorrow

178
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,980
Your breakfast is here, my boss

179
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,980
Hello!

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,980
Your breakfast is here

181
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,580
My boss

182
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you here?

183
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,900
You’re here

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,000
He actually takes my order seriously

185
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,660
Boss!

186
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,400
I’m coming!

187
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
Good

188
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,740
Put them in the dish for me

189
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,460
May I go into your house, sir!

190
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,220
Fine

191
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,800
Do you expect me to eat my breakfast here?

192
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
You want to eat here?

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,580
I’m being sarcastic

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
Should I close the door for you?

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,020
Of course!

196
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,460
Are you waiting for a thief to come in first?

197
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,000
Done!

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,020
My boss

199
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,000
This is the right vendor

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
Crispy

201
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Tasty

202
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,980
This is also from the same vendor

203
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,000
Good

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
Less sweet

205
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,460
A bit of basil seeds

206
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,760
Good

207
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,860
Why is it so hot?

208
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,200
Here’s the drink

209
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,340
It’s yummy

210
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,000
But why is it so hot?

211
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,420
It’s hot!

212
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,760
Right. It’s hot

213
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,120
Try to eat it again

214
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,980
I think it’s not hot anymore

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,820
Delicious?

216
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,980
Um…

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,100
Then

218
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,080
Let’s continue eating

219
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
I will cool it down for you

220
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,580
No need

221
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,980
I can do it by myself

222
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,860
Right

223
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,620
Have you eaten yet?

224
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,980
I did

225
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,420
Good

226
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,560
Do you think my house is kinda dirty?

227
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,400
Can you manage it?

228
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,420
Yes sir!

229
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,960
Will you be able to finish washing all these?

230
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,980
Of course, I can

231
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,540
My face!

232
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,600
What?

233
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Your face?

234
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,000
Your face, right?

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,680
The lights went out

236
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,860
The lights went out!

237
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,980
The lights went out then you just have to change it

238
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,760
You’re right

239
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,180
Changing the lights…

240
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,500
Changing the lights

241
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,000
I won’t be responsible if you fall down

242
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,000
A person like me won’t die easily

243
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,980
Don’t worry

244
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,980
Fine

245
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,480
I will help you hold the chair

246
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,520
I’m ready

247
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
One. Two…

248
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
It’s done

249
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,100
Okay

250
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you

251
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,200
If you hold the chair properly

252
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,980
Something like this wouldn’t happen

253
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,620
I didn’t mean it to happen

254
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,640
It was you

255
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,800
You volunteered to change the lights

256
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,180
I’m getting angry now

257
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,660
You blame me?

258
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,480
You said it’s my own fault?

259
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,500
Are you saying that I was being nosy and that’s why this happened?

260
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,960
Isn’t it true?

261
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,060
Right

262
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,220
You’re right

263
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,480
But the reason that I did it because I want you to forgive

264
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,980
I didn’t think expect that you will bully me like this

265
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,460
You think I bully you?

266
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,840
How about that time?

267
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,980
That time that you wanted to fight in front of Noh

268
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,440
Didn’t you even think that I would feel sad?

269
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,500
Listen to me

270
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,320
I have something to say

271
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,420
If you two still act like this

272
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,760
You will not be able to make love

273
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,820
I mean

274
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,480
Able to understand each other

275
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,100
Do you know why?

276
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,900
Because both of you don’t listen to each other

277
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
You demand another person to listen to yourself

278
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,360
How can your relationship work out?

279
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,580
I want both of you to stop fighting

280
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,540
Just of back home after this

281
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,000
Go back home and think if you actually care for each other

282
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
Do you understand?

283
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,540
Okay, doc

284
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you understand?

285
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,980
I do, doc

286
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,620
Also, if you guys are going to have sex

287
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,540
Don’t forget protection

288
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,620
Use condom and lubricant gel

289
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,420
For your own good

290
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,960
Don’t use other kind of lubricants

291
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,020
Like lotion or baby oil

292
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,960
These lubricants can damage condoms

293
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,220
That’s it for today

294
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,640
You guys can go back home now

295
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,460
Slow down

296
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,300
I’m good

297
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,540
Good bye

298
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,500
Wish, what’s wrong?

299
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,020
Why are you making that face?

300
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,420
It’s because of Two

301
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
Two…

302
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,000
That guy who came into the practice room?

303
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,540
What’s going on between you two?

304
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,000
2Wish, a perfect match

305
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,060
Stop joking

306
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,480
I am not

307
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
I really want to know about both of you

308
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,580
Is it that obvious?

309
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,000
I went to the hospital. The doctor also lectured me about relationship stuff

310
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What happened to Two?

311
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
He fell down when he helped me to change the light bulb

312
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,960
Stupid

313
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,420
Why did he have to help you to change the light bulb?

314
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,980
Are you sure that you guys are not in a relationship?

315
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,000
We are not

316
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,560
Just tell him the truth that you and Two like each other

317
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,980
Sorn!

318
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,000
Two asked you to be his boyfriend before

319
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,320
Sorn!

320
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
So, you guys are together?

321
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,800
It’s complicated

322
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,980
I don’t know why it’s so complicated

323
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,980
Why is it complicated?

324
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,000
I just feel that…

325
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can be myself when I’m with him

326
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,300
I don’t like to see him with someone else

327
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,580
That’s it

328
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,680
You’re saying you want to be the only one who can be by his side?

329
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,060
It’s not that

330
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,960
I just don’t like to see him with someone else

331
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,080
It means you like him

332
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,140
No

333
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,160
Let me ask you then

334
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,400
If he asks you to be his boyfriend, what’s your answer?

335
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,580
No

336
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,960
Seriously?

337
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,920
I don’t know

338
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,580
How about this

339
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,000
I know that it’s hard to accept it

340
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,980
It was hard for me too

341
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,500
But when I actually thought about it

342
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I couldn’t deny my feeling

343
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,940
There’s the only thing I regret

344
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,240
I regret that I didn’t admit my feeling since the beginning

345
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,940
If I did, I could find happiness earlier

346
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,960
That’s the only thing I regret

347
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,400
What should I do?

348
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,540
Well…

349
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,500
Let me ask you again

350
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,740
What if…

351
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,700
He asks you to be his boyfriend right now, what will you say?

352
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,600
Um!

353
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,980
That’s it

354
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,360
I have to wait for him to ask me?

355
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,360
You

356
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,780
Don’t have to wait for him to ask you

357
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,980
If you like him, just let him know

358
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,880
I don’t want to do that

359
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
I will lose my cool

360
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,120
Also

361
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,960
I like it when he’s serious

362
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,480
It’s funny

363
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Wish

364
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,500
What do you want?

365
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,980
What I do for you is never enough?

366
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,240
Wait

367
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
Who are you talking to?

368
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,000
Since when did you come in?

369
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,980
I’m not talking to anyone

370
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,980
I didn’t say anything

371
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
I know

372
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,460
It’s about Wish, right?

373
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,440
How was it?

374
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,980
Did you guys make up?

375
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,540
What are you talking about?

376
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I did everything he asked

377
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,540
I was his slave

378
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,000
He hasn’t forgiven me yet

379
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,140
Whatever

380
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,000
I don’t think he likes me

381
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,660
Don’t tell me that you think there’s something between Noh and Wish

382
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,000
Of course, not

383
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,980
I don’t even think about it

384
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
I couldn’t care less

385
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,900
I don’t care

386
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,000
I went to talk to Phun

387
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,000
I don’t think there’s something going between Noh and Wish

388
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,920
That’s good

389
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
Whatever

390
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
It’s not my business

391
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,720
How about this

392
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
If you don’t trust me

393
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,980
You should go see Phun with me

394
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,780
I will go with you

395
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,000
I won’t

396
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,540
Why would I go?

397
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,520
Let me tell you something

398
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,000
Phun is such a good advisor

399
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Maybe you will learn something from him

400
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,980
You might see something clearer

401
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,520
Trust me

402
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,460
Let’s go

403
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
You don’t have to pull me!

404
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,400
Why everyone thinks that Noh likes to flirt?

405
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,560
This is funny

406
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,740
Aren’t you jealous?

407
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,980
What if someone actually flirts with Noh?

408
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,960
He will tell me

409
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,980
He’s stupid. He doesn’t know who flirts with him and he’s bad at rejecting people

410
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,980
What will you do then?

411
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,460
I didn’t even see that you guys put relationship status

412
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,200
We did for a while

413
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,420
But then Noh won a music competition

414
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,420
There are more fans

415
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,020
Someone hacked his FB

416
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,580
He made a new FB so we didn’t put our relationship status

417
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,960
You see

418
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,500
If you changed your relationship status

419
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,020
We won’t be this worried

420
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,380
True!

421
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,000
You know how hard it is before Noh put his relationship status

422
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,360
What did you do then?

423
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,760
I give him time

424
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
I didn’t pressure him

425
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,500
The more pressure, the less I get the answer

426
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,820
Give him time

427
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,720
Keep waiting

428
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,460
What if I keep waiting and he doesn’t choose me in the end?

429
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,580
Have you heard this phrase?

430
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,000
As the poet says, ‘when there is love, there is hope’

431
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,480
If you really love Wish, there is already a hope

432
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,000
It sounds like a song

433
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I think I heard it before

434
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,920
What should I do then?

435
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,500
Should I try again?

436
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,320
What if I do

437
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,640
And it doesn’t work out

438
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
This is too hard

439
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,600
I think you will know it when you find the right one

440
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,980
You are my idol

441
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Let’s take a picture together

442
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,240
Awesome

443
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,000
Keep firing

444
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Fighting!

445
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,660
I know my accent is a bit wrong

446
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,140
There’s English tutor in front of our university. Noh also goes there

447
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,980
Noh goes to learn there?

448
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,440
Yes. I will give you guys brochure next time

449
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,740
I thought Sorn teaches him English

450
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,900
Or…

451
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,480
There’s something you didn’t tell me

452
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,380
What? There’s nothing

453
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,380
I think it has something to do with Wish

454
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,760
What about Wish?

455
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Is this about Sorn?

456
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,740
I just knew this from you that Sorn teaches Noh English

457
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,200
You guys are together

458
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,000
You should know

459
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,740
You can play now

460
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,100
You’re awesome

461
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Thanks to you

462
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,220
Now

463
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,000
Tomorrow

464
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,380
You don’t have to worry

465
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,760
You can do it

466
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,660
Anyway

467
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,440
If there’s some part that I can’t do, I will call you then

468
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,620
It’s late already. Just go back home

469
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
Do you want me to help cleaning up the room?

470
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,580
It’s okay

471
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,400
I can do it. You can go back first

472
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,600
Okay

473
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,560
See you

474
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,760
See you

475
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Here’s your guitar

476
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,060
Wish

477
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,980
Are you inside the house?

478
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,480
Wish

479
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Are you there?

480
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,000
Wish

481
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:42,960
Hello

482
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Is anybody home?

483
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,000
Come in

484
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Why didn’t you call me when you’re here?

485
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,740
I asked you why you didn’t tell me?

486
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,020
Sit here

487
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,000
Two

488
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,000
I was thinking

489
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,520
From now on

490
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
You can pick me up every morning

491
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,380
No

492
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,500
How about

493
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Dropping me off every day

494
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,980
Okay?

495
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,000
No

496
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,020
You never care about my feelings

497
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,380
You think I’m stupid

498
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,420
I’m just your toy

499
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,980
You’re giving me hope

500
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,580
I didn’t expect anything in the beginning

501
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,820
Two

502
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,500
Let’s stop

503
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,000
If you’re not serious about my feeling for you

504
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,420
I don’t expect that we will be together

505
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,000
Two

506
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,120
I…

507
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,600
No

508
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I’m going home now

509
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,000
Why are you calling me now?

510
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,740
Why are you following me?

511
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,360
I come here to see you

512
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,360
You have time to see me now?

513
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,400
I had exam at 8 AM today

514
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
You called me 10 PM last night

515
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,880
I still had three more chapters to study

516
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,360
I didn’t have enough time

517
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,360
I didn’t have enough time?

518
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,980
But you have time to go drink coffee and take picture with your new friend?

519
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,680
No

520
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,440
Pin came with his friend

521
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
But his friend wasn’t in the picture

522
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,780
Also

523
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,980
Those two come to see and ask me for advice

524
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,080
You want me to tell them to go back?

525
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,980
Isn’t that a bit mean?

526
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
You told me to go back before

527
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,980
When I’m free

528
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,540
I always go to see you

529
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,380
But when you’re free

530
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,960
I never see you make an effort to visit me

531
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,960
If it’s so hard to come and see me

532
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,980
You can stop it

533
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,000
What are you doing?

534
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,740
Why you didn’t tell me first that you will come?

535
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,620
If I told you, you won’t be surprised then

536
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,960
Right

537
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,520
You have a guitar?

538
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,980
Why didn’t you tell me you were going to buy? I can help you choose

539
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
This is a good guitar

540
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,980
You secretly play it?

541
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,000
You should have told me. I can teach you

542
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,980
The sound is so nice

543
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,680
I…

544
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,980
What song are you playing?

545
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,960
Pin!

546
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,360
What’s this?

547
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Listen to me first

548
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,980
(You can do it. From: Handsome Noh)

549
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
I…

550
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,980
Noh?

551
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,140
I…

552
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
There’s nothing between me and him

553
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,860
Nothing?

554
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,320
Noh is hitting on you, right?

555
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,000
No, he’s not

556
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,000
If he’s not then what is this?

557
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,600
It’s nothing

558
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,960
What the fuck?

559
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,440
Calm down and listen to me

560
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,460
Listen to you?

561
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,000
I always trusted you

562
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,460
What else should I listen?

563
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,000
You told me you went to teach him English

564
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,420
I talked to Phun already

565
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
He told me otherwise

566
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,980
And now this

567
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Pin!

568
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Can I still trust you?

569
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,980
Stop it

570
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,920
Listen to me

571
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,480
Listen to you

572
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,960
If I do something wrong, why don’t you tell me?

573
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,980
Why don’t you tell me?

574
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,960
You promised me

575
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,980
If we face any obstacles

576
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
We have to tell each other

577
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,960
Stop it

578
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,400
Stop it?

579
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,000
You want me to stop?

580
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,480
Okay

581
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,000
Let’s end our relationship then

582
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Let’s stop it

583
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,540
Pin!
