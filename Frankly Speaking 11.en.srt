00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,770
- What time is it?
- Get some more sleep.

3
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:26,193
Honey bunny, I'm your raccoon

4
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,414
Shake, shake away
Let's have some fun

5
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,011
Shake away
Let's have some fun

6
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,559
And look cool

7
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,697
Hey, you.

8
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,824
Two geun of pork shoulder, right?

9
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,618
Actually, three geun of belly.
Top-quality pork belly.

10
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,704
Your son must make
a lot of money these days.

11
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:21,957
- Someone's become a big spender.
- How could I spend his money?

12
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:25,878
I keep telling him to save his money
but he won't listen to me.

13
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:28,213
Hey, have you heard of the Gold Resort?

14
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,924
It costs a million won a night
to stay there.

15
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:34,428
He kept insisting we go and stay there.
Gosh, he kills me.

16
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:35,971
Must be nice.

17
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,608
Hey, Son.

18
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:48,859
Oh, Mom.

19
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,737
- It's not heavy.
- Give it to me.

20
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,739
- It is heavy. Let go.
- No, it's not.

21
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,200
- Coming from the bathhouse?
- Yes.

22
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,619
You're glowing, Son.

23
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,955
We should eat out occasionally.
This is heavy.

24
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:05,208
Why should we eat out?
The food I make tastes so much better.

25
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,252
I don't want you to work so much.

26
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,672
You've changed.

27
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,470
- Ki-baek.
- Yes?

28
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,807
You know the singing school
where I go sell my products, right?

29
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:21,808
Yeah.

30
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,894
There's someone named Ms. Park.

31
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:26,605
She always buys
a lot of skincare products from me.

32
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:32,653
Ms. Park asked me if it'd be possible
to invite you to the class.

33
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:37,157
I told her, "My son is busy.
He doesn't have time to come here."

34
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:38,408
I told her that, but...

35
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,035
- Sure. I'll be there.
- What?

36
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:42,704
Oh, really?

37
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:45,415
Let me know the date and time.
I can't sing though.

38
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,042
Don't you worry about that.

39
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:51,505
The moment you show up,
all the ladies there will faint.

40
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,091
I'll set a sales record that day.

41
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,718
Only if you sing.

42
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,220
What?

43
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,015
Instead of going there to sell
your products, you should sing too.

44
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,143
I'll sign you up for the class.

45
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:09,106
Hey, I have no time to sing.

46
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:11,191
Fine. I won't come.

47
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:18,323
Thanks, Son.

48
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:20,909
Let's go.

49
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,169
Watch out for cars.

50
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:56,987
Ki-baek.

51
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:10,917
Mom.

52
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,660
We performed surgery
for the external injuries,

53
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,996
but she'd lost a lot of blood,

54
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,707
so she's very unstable right now.

55
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:53,710
She might require additional
surgical procedures.

56
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,257
At the moment, I can't guarantee
she'll regain consciousness.

57
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:12,479
I suggest you and your family
prepare yourselves for the worst.

58
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:28,078
Mom turned the steering wheel
toward herself.

59
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:31,373
That's why none of us got hurt.

60
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,043
Mom's the only one who got hurt.

61
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,379
Only Mom.

62
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,245
Mom's surgery went well,

63
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,248
so we just need to wait
for her to wake up.

64
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:17,252
Hey. Mom will be okay, right?

65
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,923
When will she wake up?

66
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:23,383
Soon.

67
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:26,845
She'll wake up soon.

68
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:31,725
Mom, what should we do?

69
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,787

EPISODE 11: 💞 kissasian.one 💞

HONEY BUNNY AND THE RACCOON

71
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,543
Where is Jeong-heon?

72
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:02,297
This is nuts. Seriously.

73
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:03,798
Last night, he was at home--

74
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,592
Last night? Are you kidding me?

75
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,011
Hurry up and find Jeong-heon. Now!

76
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:08,929
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,056
Hyeong-taek.

78
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,851
Find him no matter what, or you're fired.
You got that?

79
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:15,769
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:25,487
- I'm your raccoon
- I'm your raccoon

81
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,239
- Even if you call me sly
- Even if you call me sly

82
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,491
- No matter what you say
- No matter what you say

83
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,452
- I'll always be right by your side
- I'll always be right by your side

84
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:36,748
You're my adorable chubby chub chub

85
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:39,000
You have to be confident when you sing.

86
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,504
I feel uncomfortable
because you keep staring at me.

87
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,841
More people will stare at you
at the singing competition.

88
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:51,221
My mom is making me do it.
She says I'm way too timid.

89
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:54,266
She said she'd buy me 50,000 won worth
of game items if I sang onstage.

90
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,267
Really?

91
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,977
I'm so jealous.

92
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,979
Sparkle, sparkle
I see no one but you

93
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:02,023
I hate it when people look at me.

94
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,567
It scares me.

95
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,734
I hear you.

96
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:09,155
As if the eyeballs staring at you
will pop out.

97
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,490
Doesn't it make you dizzy?

98
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,825
Yeah, totally.

99
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:19,291
By the way, why does the raccoon call
the bunny his soulmate?

100
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,045
Good question.

101
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,883
A bunny and a raccoon
don't sound like a compatible pair.

102
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:35,348
Anyway, I'm off. Good luck.

103
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,226
Hey, mister. Wait.

104
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:42,105
It'll take place downtown.
Will you come and watch?

105
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,190
I'm a busy man.

106
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,984
Aren't you unemployed?

107
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,194
No, I'm not.

108
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:51,698
My mom told me every man sitting out here
during the day was jobless.

109
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:52,824
Really?

110
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:54,367
Man.

111
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,330
Well, sorry. I don't like that song.

112
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,999
Wait, mister!

113
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,459
Don't follow me.

114
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,178
Go and do what you need to do.

115
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:15,472
I'll be here.

116
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,644
The visiting hours are set.

117
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,854
You can't see her
even if you sit here all day.

118
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:32,155
You should go home and get changed.

119
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,201
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

120
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,928
Mr. Song?

121
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:57,097
Oh, Dr. Kim.

122
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,770
You must be in shock.

123
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,355
Your whole family, in fact.

124
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:06,356
Yes.

125
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:12,529
I was so flustered
that I didn't realize you worked here.

126
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,496
When you work at a hospital,

127
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,958
you often see people cry.

128
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:37,929
Being sick is...

129
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,144
Well, it's really awful and sad.

130
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,649
Perhaps a hospital is a place

131
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,736
where you can witness
the greatest misfortunes unfold.

132
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:59,659
In the past, it was so bad
that it made me feel miserable.

133
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:03,663
But you know what?

134
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:08,126
We cry when we're sad, but there's also
a thing called happy tears.

135
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:14,632
I meet people who cry the happiest tears.

136
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,676
Yu-jin has fully recovered.

137
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,928
Right here, at this hospital.

138
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:20,472
Thank you.

139
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:25,602
The kind of tears
you'll never forget until the day you die,

140
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,020
after seeing it just once.

141
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,026
This is a place
where such things can happen,

142
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:38,656
so save your tears for later,
no matter what kind of tears they are.

143
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:42,410
Okay.

144
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,557
Ki-baek, are you all right?

145
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:19,239
I'm really okay. All right?

146
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,657
Don't worry too much.

147
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,370
Have you eaten yet?

148
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,373
Let's go eat.

149
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:31,334
Sorry, I have to go take care
of something at the office.

150
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,835
Who cares about work now?

151
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,380
I really am okay.

152
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,341
Let's go. I'll take you home.

153
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,559
Come in.

154
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,437
Yes, take a seat.

155
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:03,491

I LOVE NEWS!

I LOVE NEWS!

158

For you, Ki-baek,
the more media exposure, the better,

159
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,753
whether it's as a panelist or a guest.

160

So I'm reaching out to every program

00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:27,348
Sure, I'll go through them.

164
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:32,854
Oh, I was wondering if I could get paid up
front or get the signing bonus in advance.

165
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,606
My family's in a bit of a situation.

166
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,941
Sure, I'll do my best.

167
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:41,112
But as you know,
it may not cover what you need.

168
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:44,115
That's okay. It'll really help me out.

169
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:53,249
Yesterday was the last episode of
The Troubles of Ppong-sik's Family.

170
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,924
It's Mom's and my favorite drama.

171
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:14,145
Ki-baek, have you seen the remote?

172
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:20,026
I'm stepping out for some air.

173
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:22,403
Do you not plan on reopening the gym?

174
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,823
You should reopen tomorrow.

175
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,202
And start chipping in
for household expenses this month.

176
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,329
All right.

177
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,538
You too, Pung-baek.

178
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:35,375
If you have time to watch TV,
clean the house.

179
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,793
What is this?

180
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:40,755
If you're going to keep missing school,
take a leave of absence or drop out.

181
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,174
Okay.

182
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:46,260
Mom's in the hospital,
and you're concerned about money?

183
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,972
Are you worried
you'll have to be the breadwinner?

184
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,933
Yeah. I refuse to coddle you two
like Mom did,

185
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:56,270
so you guys need to get your act together.

186
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,282
Here. My wife made a few side dishes.

187
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:10,201
Why do you keep coming to see me?

188
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,161
You already visited my mom
in the hospital.

189
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:13,913
Hey, here.

190
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,833
What's this?

191
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,669
As you already know,
I'm broke and shameless.

192
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:23,715
It's such a small amount that I can't even
suggest you use it for the hospital bill.

193
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,426
Buy her a steak dinner
when she regains consciousness.

194
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,637
I make more money than you.
I can't take this.

195
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:31,514
Hey. Just take it.

196
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,683
If you don't, I'll be mad at you.

197
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:35,768
And Sol will hate you.

198
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:37,895
Hey, I'm off.

199
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,313
Stay and eat with me.

200
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:41,816
Sol and my wife are waiting
for me at the hospital.

201
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:45,862
You should go home too.
Take good care of your dad and brothers.

202
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:49,490
Dealing with a family member in hospital
is draining, so look after yourself.

203
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm off.

204
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:52,660
Hey.

205
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:10,511
- Why are you only eating rice again?
- I can barely swallow.

206
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,388
I can just have some rice and soup.

207
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:16,392
You need to eat well to have the energy
to chat with your family when they visit.

208
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:20,980
My dear son, Heung-su.

209
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,067
Work is stressful, isn't it? Here, eat up.

210
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,735
No, no. Heung-su is full.

211
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:28,988
- You should eat, Mom.
- It's been a while.

212
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,365
Oh, yes. Hello.

213
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,117
You should eat during your lunch break.

214
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:36,079
It's all right. I can't even visit often.

215
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,749
Are you a new caregiver?

216
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,876
My gosh. You don't know who he is?

217
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,419
You watch TV every day.

218
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,296
Guess who I am.

219
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:48,007
- It's you!
- Yes.

220
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,842
You're Yu Jae-seok!

221
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:52,970
Yes, this protruding mouth.
You are Yu Jae-seok.

222
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,514
- No, he's not.
- He's Yu Jae-seok?

223
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:57,016
- You're not Yu Jae-seok?
- Then who is he?

224
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,312
The son of Mr. Kim,
who runs the first-floor snack shop!

225
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,481
You're Dong-gu. Right?

226
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,774
Yes, Dong-gu.

227
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:07,652
- He's Dong-gu.
- Dong-gu.

228
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:19,038
What's up? Did something break?

229
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,833
Come sit here.

230
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,792
What?

231
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,340
Have you eaten?

232
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:32,718
Have you been sleeping?

233
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,432
So you haven't been eating
or sleeping. My goodness.

234
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,687
Try and get some sleep here.

235
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,698
Starting tomorrow, I'll be very busy.

236
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,783
Don't overwork yourself.

237
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,912
I have to take on
as much work as possible.

238
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:04,167
We have to hold out and make ends meet
until my mom wakes up.

239
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,256
Come with me.

240
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:12,425
What?

241
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:17,054
My mom used to wash my hair

242
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:20,057
in the shampoo station like this,
from time to time.

243
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:24,812
I enjoyed the minty sensation
as she was massaging my scalp.

244
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,856
I always felt so refreshed after.

245
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:29,400
I like it too.

246
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:33,529
So I occasionally pestered
my mom to wash my hair

247
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,574
when I was feeling anxious or sad.

248
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:41,037
When your hair is soaked with warm water,

249
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:42,955
and you feel the pressure
of the fingertips

250
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:45,458
and the delicate foam
on your scalp and hair...

251
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:50,838
You fall asleep.

252
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,534
DAWN DELIVERY

253
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:23,079
My goodness.

254
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,039
Mr. Song, you're here.

255
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,874
I brought the stuff.

256
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:28,042
There's quite a bit.

257
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,711
You probably don't want to get rid
of all this stuff.

258
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:31,879
Is this everything?

259
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:35,216
There's some left. It's about this much.
I couldn't fit them all.

260
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:36,342
I'll make another trip.

261
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,135
Let's take them inside.

262
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:39,178
Thank you.

263
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:41,931
Just count on me.
I'll take care of everything.

264
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,601
How's your wife? Is she all right?

265
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:48,896
I've been meaning to visit her
in the hospital.

266
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:54,360
Whoa, who's this pretty lady?

267
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,321
Did you have a chat with your boyfriend?

268
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:01,993
I wanted to comfort him,
but he told me not to worry.

269
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,119
He said he was okay.

270
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:04,787
The way he said it,

271
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,915
it made him sound invincible.

272
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,917
You believe that obvious lie?

273
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,086
He doesn't lie.

274
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,963
Everybody lies.

275
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,506
Trust me. He doesn't.

276
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,884
Fine, whatever.
I'm heading out to see my boyfriend.

277
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:24,849
What?

278
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,518
Did you call her?

279
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,981
God, you're such a wimp.

280
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:34,650
Who do you take after?

281
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,569
You, obviously.

282
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:38,654
Fine. Do whatever you want, wimp.

283
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,705
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

284
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,876
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

285
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:55,755
Here's yours, Gu-won.

286
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,472
Mom, can you open this for me?

287
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:05,389
Sure.

288
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:17,401
Hey, Gu-won. Are you still mad at me?

289
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:22,073
- Mom.
- Yeah?

290
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,200
Su-a and I broke up.

291
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:30,790
You did what?

292
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,211
Su-a likes Seong-bin more now.

293
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:40,633
So I told our teacher
that she betrayed me.

294
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:45,763
Gu-won. You're nine years old, right?

295
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:51,936
My teacher told me you can't control
your feelings when you like someone,

296
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,815
just like when you're hungry or sleepy.

297
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:58,234
That's probably how you feel too.

298
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,361
Because you like that guy.

299
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:12,164
Gu-won, you're my best output.

300
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,376
Output? What's that?

301
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:21,257
It means
you're the greatest gift of my life.

302
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,177
You know, he's no match for me.

303
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:26,428
Really?

304
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:29,098
You'll be my mom forever,

305
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:32,935
but you and that guy
might break up later on.

306
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:35,396
Just like me and Su-a.

307
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,153
Come on, Mom. Ride with me.

308
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:44,321
All right.

309
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,577
Hey, Mom. You're an adult.

310
00:23:49,577 --> 00:23:51,287
Why can't you ride a two-wheeler?

311
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,289
Two-wheelers scare me.

312
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,082
You can't even open a soda can.

313
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:59,086
That's because I'm only nine.
I'll master that skill once I turn ten.

314
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,964
I'll learn to ride a two-wheeler
by the time I'm 40.

315
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,675
Even nine-year-olds can do it.

316
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,636
Gu-won. Don't let go, okay?

317
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,013
- Mom.
- Yeah?

318
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,890
You can't even ride a bike without me.

319
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,183
Are you really a mom?

320
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,102
Hey, I bought this bike and yours too.

321
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,021
Don't let go, okay?

322
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,772
Don't let go, all right?

323
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:22,902
I'm riding on my own?

324
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:26,113
Wow, this is so cool!

325
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:31,327
This is really fun, Gu-won.

326
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,758
COUPLE'S PARADISE

327
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:03,275
It takes skill to look this pitiful.

328
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,029
Didn't you say no one would use
this office for a while?

329
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,616
Not "for a while."
No one uses this office, period.

330
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:12,993
It just goes to show
how poorly we were treated.

331
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:16,789
Hey, I shot you guys up to the 20th floor.

332
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,584
Do you have to work here
and make me feel bad?

333
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,169
Looking all pitiful at that.

334
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,048
I'll just hang out here
since everything I need is already set up.

335
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:29,343
So, what are you working on? Got an idea?

336
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,527
This is refreshing.

337
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,486
Right?

338
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:49,405
Have you seen anything like this before?

339
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:50,948
No, never.

340
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,742
Who'd take this on?

341
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,662
I'm still working on it.

342
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:58,622
I'll show you once I finalize the details.

343
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:02,209
If you need my help with anything,

344
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,502
well, let me know, or not.

345
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:07,298
Oh, look at you. You ooze charisma
now that you're a head writer.

346
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:08,549
Whatever.

347
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:14,847
Anyway, how's Song Ki-baek doing?

348
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,685
"Mr. Song is on the Move!"

349
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:22,938
Today, I came here to meet
Mr. Heo Pung-seon,

350
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:26,900
also known as Mr. Balloon, who travels
all over the country with his balloons

351
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,528
and makes children laugh
everywhere he goes.

352
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:32,114
He's the second most popular celebrity
among kids,

353
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,616
number one being Pororo.

354
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:36,118
Thank you.

355
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,203
Many fans are here to see him.

356
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:40,039
Kids, do you like Mr. Balloon?

357
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,998
- Yes!
- Yes!

358
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,375
If you like Mr. Balloon, make some noise!

359
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,838
Oh, my. He's very popular indeed.

360
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:51,050
The children's innocent smiles are
lifting my spirits.

361
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,634
Attack Song Ki-baek!

362
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:53,552
- Hey.
- All right!

363
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:55,471
All right, kids. I'm Song Ki-baek!

364
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,604
I heard you do several
children's events like this daily.

365
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:04,813
It's amazing.

366
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:11,236
I'm so impressed that
you can keep smiling like that.

367
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,615
It makes me happy
to see someone look at me and smile.

368
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,951
Of course,
I've become a person who has to smile

369
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:19,661
even on days I don't want to.

370
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:21,705
But it would be weird
if a clown didn't smile.

371
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,501
A clown's smile?

372
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,754
I'm sure you know what I mean.

373
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:46,021
THE SHOOT WENT WELL
HOPE YOUR DAY IS GOING WELL TOO

374
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,774
MR. SONG IS ON THE MOVE

375
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:58,158
Did you call her?

376
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:16,111
I'm moving abroad. I leave tomorrow

377
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,781
with my son and his family.

378
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:21,283
Once I leave,

379
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:27,331
I won't be able to see you
for a long time.

380
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,800
Do you know my name?

381
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:41,637
Woo-ju.

382
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:48,060
I had to start school,

383
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,772
but I didn't have a name.

384
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:57,903
We're not talking about a backpack,
running shoes or pretty clothes.

385
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,406
I didn't have a name,

386
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:04,701
so I couldn't go to school.

387
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:09,665
So my mom named me.

388
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:12,125
On Woo-ju.

389
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:21,593
In front of...

390
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:27,558
the children's home where you'd left me...

391
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:33,647
I was afraid someone would come out
and take me inside.

392
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:38,193
I thought I might never see you again
if that happened,

393
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,739
so I ran away and walked for a while.

394
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,618
Then I met Bok-ja.

395
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,498
It'll sound like an excuse,

396
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:58,213
but I did go back to that children's home
a few years later.

397
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:04,177
Ms. On Bok-ja had left
her contact information,

398
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,681
thinking your parents
might come back to find you.

399
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,227
But I didn't call her.

400
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:16,064
I just watched you from afar,

401
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:18,650
while hiding.

402
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,196
But this time, once I leave...

403
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:29,953
I may never get to see you again.

404
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:45,802
I'm sorry.

405
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:52,517
I'm so sorry for everything.

406
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,746
Stay healthy and take care of yourself.

407
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:16,249
I'll do the same.

408
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:47,322
Thank you for bringing me into this world
and for sending me to my mom.

409
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:50,993
Thank you.

410
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:27,112
Hey, Woo-ju.

411
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:31,199
Ki-baek.

412
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:50,177
I met my biological mother.

413
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:57,768
I had a lot on my mind
but now I know why I felt so conflicted.

414
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:03,523
I think I just missed her.

415
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:06,818
Do you feel better
now that you've met her?

416
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:09,279
I feel lighter.

417
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:12,616
I'm glad I listened to you
and met with her.

418
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:15,535
Oh, hold on.

419
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,336
It's for you.

420
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:28,173
This will make me look too cute.

421
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:32,094
Wow, I knew it'd look cute on you,
but this is way too cute.

422
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,097
So how was your day?

423
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,682
Oh, my day was...

424
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,479
All in all, I had a good day.

425
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:48,401
Why do your smiles seem fake
to me these days?

426
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:51,071
I haven't been fake smiling at all.

427
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:52,948
Are you lying...

428
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:57,494
It can't be a lie.

429
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,498
I may not look it,
but I'm a strong person.

430
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,876
- It's just a little strange.
- No, it isn't.

431
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:06,795
Let's go.

432
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:08,964
You're cute.

433
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:12,551
You always say I'm cute.

434
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:14,386
Well, because you are cute.

435
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:17,139
If you keep saying it,
it'll become a habit.

436
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:46,710
Did you drink?

437
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,878
No, I didn't.

438
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:50,881
Then we have a bigger problem.
Hey, Daughter.

439
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:52,591
Are you all right?

440
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,010
I'm totally fine. Isn't this cute?

441
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:56,595
You're crazy.

442
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:01,057
I'm going to sleep here too.
Next to my mom.

443
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:04,561
Whatever. You're such a weirdo too.

444
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:06,897
I mean, what is this?

445
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,024
My goodness.

446
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:33,506

This is my job, and I drive safely.

450
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,444
You don't need to report everything to me.

451
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,571
You're trying to figure out your life.

452
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,448
Where's Dad going?

453
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:07,832
Mr. Jang!

454
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,752

PROPOSAL BY ON WOO-JU

459
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:45,578
RECENT CALLS
POOPY KI-BAEK

460
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,333
Ki-baek, are you all right?

461
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,127
I'm really okay.

462
00:37:52,127 --> 00:37:55,005
- So how was your day?
- I had a good day.

463
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,257
I may not look it,
but I'm a strong person.

464
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,396
Hello, Chief.

465
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,273
Yes, yes.

466
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,277
Yes. That's right.

467
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:19,654
Everyone uses a washing machine
to do laundry.

468
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:22,407
That is true,
but there's something very satisfying

469
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,784
about seeing
clean laundry hung on the line.

470
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,747
You want to shove me into
a washing machine? That's not good.

471
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:32,292
Wait, please don't say no outright.

472
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,711
Wait. Chief? Hello?

473
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:41,760
Oh, no.

474
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:46,598
Oh, I lost an earbud.
I was wondering if it was here.

475
00:38:46,598 --> 00:38:47,682
Your earbud?

476
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,684
Where did it go?

477
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:52,395
Man, it's not here.

478
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:54,481
Call me if you see my earbud.

479
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:57,233
- Where could it be?
- All right.

482
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,707
I can't take this.

00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:14,417
What? Did something happen?

484
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,752
My life is so boring.

485
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:17,253
There's nothing fun in life.

486
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:21,257
The same tasks, the same program.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

487
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:27,555
Maybe I should do something new,
something refreshing.

488
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,973
For example--

489
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,183
For example?

490
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:31,768
LAUNDRY

491
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,978
- Laundry?
- Hey.

492
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:37,774
Don't even. What did I say?
Even if you have to work as a servant--

493
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:41,403
Work for a wealthy family.
But I've done a lot of thinking,

494
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:43,029
and I think I'm a trailblazer.

495
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,948
I must've learned it from you.

496
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,075
So it's all on you.

497
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:50,286
No. I hope you didn't say
anything to I-na about--

498
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,163
He said nothing to me.

499
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:53,415
How mean.

500
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,419
Can't I do something refreshing
with you, Min-gu?

501
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:00,004
I'm really stressed out too.

502
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,673
And laundry is my specialty.

503
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:02,590
You know that.

504
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,553
How am I going to face Yeon
and Ha-young if you guys do this?

505
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:09,722
If we lined up the writers
who want to work on Couple's Paradise,

506
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,850
it would wrap around the block twice.

507
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,269
Still, this goes against my morals.

508
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:16,729
I don't think you can afford
to worry about that.

509
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:25,947
Anyway, you two. You're not hired yet.

510
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,533
- We'll work hard! Sparta!
- We'll work hard!

511
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:29,451
Woot, woot!

512
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:32,120
My goodness.

513
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,496
Did you put this together?

514
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,291
We must secure
as many product placements as we can.

515
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,084
- I taught you well.
- Please.

516
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,881
KIM JEONG-HEON'S MANAGER
KANG HYEONG-TAEK

517
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,143
MR. AN

518
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:57,395
THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS
HAVE BEEN APPROVED

519
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:02,317
SEND 3,000,000 WON
TO SONG IN-SU?

520
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,527
3,000,000 WON HAS BEEN SENT
TO SONG IN-SU

521
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,240
FATHER

522
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:16,956
MOM WILL BE ALL RIGHT
DON'T OVERWORK YOURSELF

523
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:25,381
YOU NEED TO
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DAD

524
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,390
I SENT SOME MONEY
TO HELP OUT WITH EXPENSES

525
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,442
MY WOO-JU

526
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:48,696
Hi. I'm working.

527
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:50,990
I'm at the playground.

528
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,876
You couldn't lie. What happened?

529
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:06,214
Now, I can lie.

530
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:10,343
I think it all started here
after my mom's accident.

531
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:16,182
Then you can now hide your feelings
when you want to.

532
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:17,642
Isn't that a good thing?

533
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:21,396
Well, but I have no idea what's going on.

534
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:25,608
Suddenly, there was the switch.
Then it broke, and then...

535
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,779
It's so bizarre.

536
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:35,410
Well, you suddenly developed
the inability to hide your feelings.

537
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,954
Maybe it was triggered
by the accident at first.

538
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:40,373
Back then,
you suddenly couldn't lie at all.

539
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:42,834
Now you can lie whenever you want to.

540
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:48,798
Perhaps all of this was caused
by your desperate sincerity.

541
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:54,804
Your feelings toward Ms. On
couldn't be hidden because it was love.

542
00:42:55,388 --> 00:43:01,311
And now you're lying
because you care for your family.

543
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:08,192
From now on,
I guess you can choose to lie or not.

544
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:14,240
So I've decided to hide my feelings again.

545
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:18,411
If I collapse, everything will fall apart.

546
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:23,416
I have to protect
my family and the people I love.

547
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:28,421
And I knew you'd be
even more heartbroken than me.

548
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,133
That's why I said I was okay.

549
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:36,137
Song Ki-baek!

550
00:43:36,763 --> 00:43:38,139
Have you learned anything?

551
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:40,558
"Instead of worrying
what others might think

552
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:44,270
and keeping everything bottled up inside,
just say what you want to say."

553
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,272
You said that yourself, you idiot!

554
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:50,943
Sorry.

555
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:52,528
That's all right.

556
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:54,989
I thought it was odd.

557
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:58,159
You kept saying you were okay
when there's no way you could be.

558
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,537
But I knew you couldn't be forced,

559
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:04,332
so I told myself to just trust you
and wait. I thought,

560
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:08,503
if he comes to me to be comforted,
I'm going to give him a big hug.

561
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:14,258
I love you.

562
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,056
I hate you.

563
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:25,520
You don't need to hide stuff
from the people you love,

564
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,440
so don't hide anything from me
or your family either.

565
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:32,276
If you do, that is cheating.

566
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:02,348
KIM JEONG-HEON INTERVIEW

567
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,105
Thought you couldn't stand
the sight of me.

568
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:12,567
You can't take your eyes off me.

569
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:14,485
All done.

570
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:19,532
When I was little...

571
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:24,245
I was happiest when we lived here,

572
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,664
although I never told you.

573
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:30,751
Mom said you liked this neighborhood too

574
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,590
and you wanted to visit where we lived
when my brother and I were kids.

575
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:42,597
I wanted to become super successful
and make you proud, Dad.

576
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,019
And Mom, who always worried about me,
I thought it'd make her smile too.

577
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,652
And the person I hurt in the past...

578
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,699
I thought things would be different
if we met again.

579
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:08,498
I don't know what I worked so hard for.

580
00:46:36,651 --> 00:46:37,985
RECENT CALLS
KIM JEONG-HEON

581
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:38,903
CALLING
KIM JEONG-HEON

582
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:43,366
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

583
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,621
Jeong-heon disappeared?

584
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:51,791
He said he wanted to retire.

585
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:56,879
I was wondering
if you might know where he could be.

586
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:12,562
MY WOO-JU

587
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:16,440
Hey, you need to hear this.

588
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,692
Huh? What?

589
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:19,860
Dad got scammed!

590
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,279
What?

591
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:25,491
Dad handed over
Mom's leftover inventory and new orders

592
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:29,620
to some guy who offered to sell them,
but now he's gone AWOL.

593
00:47:49,473 --> 00:47:50,766
No one's here?

594
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:56,981
It's not there.

595
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,544
Are you sure
the stationery store is this way?

596
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:20,254
If we can't get glue, we're screwed.

597
00:48:20,254 --> 00:48:23,174
Just trust me and follow me.
I know this town very well.

598
00:48:23,174 --> 00:48:24,800
I don't think we'll find one.

599
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:28,262
Wow. How did you know
there was a stationery store here?

600
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:30,097
I lived here when I was little.

601
00:48:30,723 --> 00:48:31,557
Really?

602
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:34,727
Yeah, I really loved living here.

603
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,520
It hasn't changed at all.

604
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:39,857
I'm going to live here once I retire.

605
00:48:39,857 --> 00:48:41,776
I'll build a mansion.

606
00:48:43,194 --> 00:48:44,195
Die, die.

607
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:48,366
Nice. You lost again.

608
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:50,701
Go practice some more.

609
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:54,205
But you lost yesterday. Scoot over.

610
00:48:54,205 --> 00:48:57,792
- You lost. Give someone else a turn.
- Hurry up. Do better.

611
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:00,336
I told you not to hit me.

612
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:06,425
Hey, Woo-ju.

613
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:08,511
What are you doing here?

614
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:18,604
No one's inside?

615
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:20,147
Hurry up and go inside.

616
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,902
Dad, look. Over there.

617
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:35,371
Damn it.

618
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,670
- They're not here.
- Dad, here.

619
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:44,505
Should we take this?

620
00:49:44,505 --> 00:49:45,923
Don't touch what's not ours.

621
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:50,010
Damn it. What if he already ran off?

622
00:49:52,263 --> 00:49:54,390
They've just emptied this warehouse.

623
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:02,064
Someone's observant.

624
00:50:06,694 --> 00:50:10,322
Let's get out of here.
This place is too dangerous.

625
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:11,240
What?

626
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,992
What's the point of staying here?

627
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:16,704
If we wait and ask for our stuff back,
you think he'll gladly give it back?

628
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:18,414
Then why did you follow us?

629
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,666
Should we stand idly by
and do nothing then?

630
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,084
We came all the way here.

631
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:27,423
I'm meeting Mr. Jang. I won't budge
until I get this situation sorted out.

632
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:30,301
I have to do something.

633
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:34,221
I'll get it sorted out. Don't worry.

634
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:36,724
I'll figure something out.

635
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:42,521
Dad, did your business go bust again?

636
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:47,026
Your homeroom teacher called.

637
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:49,320
Did you get into a fight at school?

638
00:50:50,237 --> 00:50:51,238
Are you all right?

639
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:53,073
It was nothing.

640
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:57,119
Do I have to transfer to another school?

641
00:50:58,662 --> 00:51:02,416
As for your transfer, I'll visit
your school tomorrow and take care of it.

642
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:05,628
Come on in. Let's eat.
I'll fix you dinner.

643
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,764
I'll run to the grocery store and--

644
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,557
Don't worry about it. I'm not hungry.

645
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:21,769
I forgot something at school.

646
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:24,980
I'll go.

647
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:31,904
Ki-baek.

648
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,244
I'm...

649
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:43,666
sorry I failed you and the family.

650
00:51:47,294 --> 00:51:49,171
Why do I have to transfer again?

651
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,216
Why do we have to run away again?

652
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,135
Go on and let it all out.

653
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:57,471
I know how you feel.

654
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,725
Dad, what do you even know about me?

655
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:03,978
Do you know that I'm a senior?

656
00:52:03,978 --> 00:52:06,272
I'm the top student.

657
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:08,524
I have the highest GPA.

658
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:11,777
Do you know what everyone calls me?

659
00:52:12,444 --> 00:52:15,614
The top student. A brainiac who comes
from a happy, affluent family.

660
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:20,578
I clean stinky motel rooms
to buy my workbooks

661
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:24,331
and eat cold rice mixed with water
in our moldy basement apartment,

662
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:27,960
but I am Song Ki-baek,
the smart top student.

663
00:52:32,673 --> 00:52:33,674
I can't take this.

664
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,345
I'm sick of being poor,

665
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:41,140
and I'm tired of my life
getting worse and worse,

666
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,643
no matter how many lies
I tell to make it better.

667
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:47,938
I'm sorry.

668
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,694
Seeing your faces
when you and Mom say you're sorry,

669
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:55,446
nothing makes me more miserable.

670
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:59,199
When I tell you and Mom that I've eaten

671
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,869
or that I'm doing fine,
you take my word for it.

672
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:05,873
You two are the worst. I hate you so much.

673
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:14,173
Ki-baek.

674
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:22,222
Ki-baek!

675
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:31,357
What happened?

676
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:32,441
Oh, my God!

677
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:33,400
What happened?

678
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,986
Isn't this a hit-and-run?
Sir, are you all right?

679
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,738
Are you all right?

680
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:42,618
Dad.

681
00:53:46,497 --> 00:53:49,500
Just don't.

682
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:53,754
Please don't do anything.

683
00:53:57,925 --> 00:53:59,760
Hey, come on.

684
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,637
It's not like Dad did it on purpose.

685
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:03,347
Mr. Jang, that swindler,

686
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:06,433
Mom and Dad have known him for years.

687
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,727
- That's enough.
- Why do you think Dad did it?

688
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:11,230
- It was all because of you!
- What?

689
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,066
You've always thought of us as a burden.

690
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:17,778
Useless burdens on
the smart Song Ki-baek's shoulders!

691
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:20,197
Have you ever thought of us as family?

692
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:23,993
Have you ever heard me say
that you were a burden?

693
00:54:23,993 --> 00:54:25,869
I don't have to hear you say it.

694
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,248
Everything you do suffocates us.
Do you even realize that?

695
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:34,503
Dad did what he did
to help lighten your burdens!

696
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:35,546
So?

697
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:38,007
Did this help lighten them?

698
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,718
You guys. That's enough.

699
00:54:40,718 --> 00:54:42,136
- Stay out of this.
- Stay out.

700
00:54:42,136 --> 00:54:43,595
I will not stay out of it!

701
00:54:44,763 --> 00:54:45,973
You always tell me that.

702
00:54:45,973 --> 00:54:48,225
I always clean up your mess
after you two fight.

703
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:50,561
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

704
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:52,855
You're both such losers. Do you know that?

705
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,648
That is enough!

706
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:01,405
Hurry up and open it.

707
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:05,659
Can't you do a better job?

708
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:07,619
You're so weak.

709
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,996
Come on!

710
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:12,332
Hey, you're a big guy.
Why are you so weak?

711
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:15,919
The ship will arrive tonight,
so let's hurry up and get everything.

712
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:17,671
It's Mr. Jang.

713
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:19,298
Dad, what should we do?

714
00:55:22,301 --> 00:55:23,260
Dad!

715
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,220
Hey, Jang Gu-pal.

716
00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:30,017
Hey. Hold on.

717
00:55:30,684 --> 00:55:32,770
Mr. Song. What are you doing here?

718
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:35,647
Your sons are here too.

719
00:55:40,194 --> 00:55:41,570
You guys stay here.

720
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:44,490
This is my fight.

721
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:48,118
Either pay me for the products
or hand them over.

722
00:55:48,118 --> 00:55:50,162
Why are you scowling? You look scary.

723
00:55:50,162 --> 00:55:52,581
As you know,
the economy is terrible right now.

724
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,583
If you just wait, I'll pay you.

725
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,335
You're so impatient.

726
00:55:57,419 --> 00:55:58,253
Hey.

727
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:01,757
It's all right.

728
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,592
I guess it's about time

729
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:06,929
I shared with you a secret
I've been keeping from you guys.

730
00:56:07,554 --> 00:56:11,183
Back in the old days, I had a nickname.

731
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,356
Beethoven from Yeonggwang County.

732
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:20,818
What the--

733
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,570
All right. Let him meet his fate.

734
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,613
Beethoven?

735
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,035
Hey.

736
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:31,537
- You okay?
- Hey!

737
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:33,038
I can't hear anything!

738
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:38,085
Those who get punched in the ear by me
all become deaf.

739
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:40,420
Ba-ba-ba-bam

740
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:42,464
Whack him!

741
00:56:43,257 --> 00:56:44,258
You piece of...

742
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,100
- Dad.
- Those idiots.

743
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:01,525
Hey! You little...

744
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:02,901
Un-baek!

745
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:06,488
How dare you.

746
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,451
Hey! You little...

747
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:12,452
- Let go!
- Dad!

748
00:57:14,204 --> 00:57:15,414
Here.

749
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,179
PUNG

750
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:33,974
UN

751
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:37,978
KI

752
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:45,819
FATHER

753
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:46,737
Get up!

754
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:48,780
Get up, damn it. Thrash them!

755
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,740
Whack them.

756
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,699
- Hey!
- Hey!

757
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:51,658
You bastards!

758
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:57,915
Don't hit him.

759
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,501
- Let go.
- Dad!

760
00:58:01,418 --> 00:58:03,128
Stop. Stop!

761
00:58:07,174 --> 00:58:08,717
You, Jang Gu-pal.

762
00:58:09,468 --> 00:58:11,303
Beethoven. No, I mean, Mr. Song.

763
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:13,222
We can talk it out.

764
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:15,516
Where are my products?

765
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:17,309
They're safe and sound.

766
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:18,810
Where are they?

767
00:58:20,145 --> 00:58:22,397
In the truck behind the warehouse.

768
00:58:32,866 --> 00:58:34,201
- Did you call the police?
- No.

769
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:36,203
It wasn't me either.

770
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:38,205
Damn it.

771
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:39,540
- Hide. Quick.
- Okay.

772
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,999
Shit!

773
00:58:45,504 --> 00:58:48,840
- What are you doing?
- Want your face to be on the news again?

774
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,386
If you think we'll get caught,
I'll walk out first.

775
00:58:52,386 --> 00:58:54,263
You stay here and don't come out.

776
00:58:54,263 --> 00:58:56,723
You're under arrest for theft and fraud.

777
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,433
You have the right to remain silent.

778
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,186
Anything you say can be used against you,

779
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:03,021
and you have the right to an attorney.

780
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,189
You know the drill.

781
00:59:04,189 --> 00:59:06,024
No, I don't know.

782
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:09,486
By the way, those guys,
why aren't you arresting them?

783
00:59:09,486 --> 00:59:10,612
Beethoven!

784
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:11,947
Over there!

785
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:13,198
Drop your head.

786
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:15,367
They're gangsters. They're right there!

787
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,327
Take him. You two, come with me.

788
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:35,596
What? There's nothing back here.

789
00:59:36,638 --> 00:59:37,889
Hey, let's go.

790
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:43,353
We got all of them, right?

791
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:45,314
We're done here, then. Let's go!

792
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:55,741
I think they're gone.

793
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:56,742
Come out.

794
01:00:16,386 --> 01:00:17,638
Dad.

795
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:19,222
I admit that I'm a loser.

796
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,270
I'm incompetent and unlucky in life.

797
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,858
My wife and children are all I have.
And that's why I've always felt so bad.

798
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,195
I didn't want to have to say sorry

799
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:36,239
even if I never got to hear thank you,
but I keep messing things up.

800
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:41,203
But I'm still your dad, you know.

801
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:46,333
If there are things I can do for you,
I'll gladly do them

802
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,670
until the day I die.

803
01:00:51,338 --> 01:00:54,675
We call each other family
and live together,

804
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:59,137
but we never rely on
or vent to each other, you know.

805
01:01:03,308 --> 01:01:04,476
Son.

806
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:07,521
Son.

807
01:01:09,356 --> 01:01:10,524
And you, Son.

808
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:14,111
Now, I need your help.

809
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:16,780
Help me, please.

810
01:01:30,627 --> 01:01:32,379
I heard you wanted to retire.

811
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:36,216
Still, how could you run away?

812
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,846
Man, I never thought you'd track me down.

813
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:44,057
You're really something.

814
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,602
You're cracking a joke right now?

815
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:51,982
One day, I just didn't want
to do anything.

816
01:01:51,982 --> 01:01:54,526
I didn't want to work or play.

817
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:57,904
Everything frustrated me.
How should I put this?

818
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:02,242
It was as if I was trapped
in a nightmare all day.

819
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:06,455
When the going got rough,
I worked harder.

820
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:08,540
And I started thinking that it was unfair.

821
01:02:09,082 --> 01:02:12,002
I mean, why put up with it all?

822
01:02:13,211 --> 01:02:16,047
It's not like I got anything
out of trying so hard.

823
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:20,552
I just wanted to relax and take it easy,
but I didn't know how.

824
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:24,556
So as you can see,

825
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:27,642
I shut everything off
and ran away like a loser.

826
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,021
You can just say that you need a break

827
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:33,648
and tell them why
you want to take it easy.

828
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:35,817
Tell who?

829
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:46,453
You don't have to go back.

830
01:02:47,662 --> 01:02:50,332
Nothing's more important than yourself.

831
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:52,834
Nothing can take precedence
when you feel like you're dying.

832
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:59,257
Just think that you're hibernating.

833
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:04,387
Did you know raccoons hibernate too?

834
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:08,225
How do you know these things?

835
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:14,022
Get some restful sleep.
Then when you wake up,

836
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:16,358
it'll be spring.

837
01:03:39,256 --> 01:03:40,465
I'm sorry.

838
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:43,718
I'm not proud of the things I've done.

839
01:03:45,303 --> 01:03:48,306
I know what you all think of me
and how much you care for me.

840
01:03:50,141 --> 01:03:54,187
But I always avoided you, saying I felt
uncomfortable and smothered.

841
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,108
It's all my fault.

842
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:01,236
The family's real burden was...

843
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,239
It was me.

844
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:07,784
I'm sorry.

845
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,253
I know

846
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:23,174
my accident must've been
a huge burden on your heart.

847
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,263
Since you've told me
your honest feelings for the first time,

848
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:31,516
I'll do the same.

849
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:36,688
I'm sorry...

850
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:42,444
and thank you.

851
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:46,948
Dad.

852
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:04,883
Sorry I yelled at you earlier, Ki-baek.

853
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:07,761
You too, Un-baek.

854
01:05:08,887 --> 01:05:09,721
Cut it out.

855
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:43,338
Dad.

856

I thought the only way for me to survive

01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:38,018
- You guys are fired.
- What?

863
01:06:38,018 --> 01:06:40,478
Go home. Don't come back here.

864
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:42,022
Can I go in there?

865
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,733
Cancel everything on my schedule.

866
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:45,650
I'm off.

867
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:49,612
- Hello.
- Oh, I see.

868
01:06:49,612 --> 01:06:51,906
I love you. How can I possibly hide it?

869
01:06:51,906 --> 01:06:53,616
Do you want to get married?

870
01:06:53,616 --> 01:06:54,784
What?
