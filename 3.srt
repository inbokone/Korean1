1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,250
Why are you calling me?

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Why are you following me?

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,000
I come here to see you

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You have time to see me now?

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
I had exam at 8 AM today

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,800
You called me 10 PM last night. I still had three more chapters to study. I didn’t have enough time

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,300
I didn’t have enough time?

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
But you have time to go drink coffee and take picture with your new friend?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Pin came with his friend

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But his friend wasn’t in the picture

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Also

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Those two come to see and ask me for advice

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
You want me to tell them to go back?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn’t that a bit mean?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
You told me to go back before

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
When I’m free

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I always go to see you

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,500
But when you’re free

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,300
I never see you make an effort to visit me

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If it’s so hard to come and see me

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can stop it

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,300
Just because of this

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,300
Just because of this?

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
We’re in our fourth year now

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,000
We will graduate soon

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
You will study abroad

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
There will be many things you have to do

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
You won’t have time to see me

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
That’s the future

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,000
Why do you have to think about it now?

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
How can I not think about it?

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We barely see each other now

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It’s really tiring

35
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
I keep worrying about you

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don’t know what is your feeling for me now

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
If we can be clear today

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,500
Isn’t that better for both of us?

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
You can meet other people who are better than me

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I don’t want other people

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,500
But…

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You promised me before, didn’t you?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You said you will never say something like this

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Listen to me

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If there’s something that make you want to stay with me forever

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have to tell me

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
I will do everything for you

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Two

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Stop it

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
If you think I’m just a toy

51
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I don’t think we can be together

52
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Two

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I…

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,500
No

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I’m going home now

56
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Are you sure?

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you sure?

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes. I’m sure

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Up to you then

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
I was going to ask you to be my boyfriend

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Huh?

62
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
What?

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I want you to be my boyfriend

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you serious?

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, I am serious!

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the first time I’m this serious

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
More serious than our 2nd grade exam

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes!

69
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
More serious than when you asked your mom to pierce your ears

70
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Um!

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
More serious than when you choose your hair color

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Why are you messing with my hair?

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I’m serious!

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Well…

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
If I become your boyfriend

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What will I get?

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tell me what do you want?

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will do everything for you

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Tonight

80
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
You have to be my slave

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Two

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Are you taking revenge on me?

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Up to you then

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Fine!

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I’ll be your slave

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
What do you want me to do?

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Close your eyes

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
I won’t. I’m not sleepy yet

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Close your eyes

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
I told you I won’t!

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
I order you to close your eyes

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
What now?

93
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,000
So…

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
We’re together now, right?

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,700
Yes

96
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
I’m so happy

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can be your boyfriend now

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who are we?

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
2WISH!

100
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
Calm down and listen to me

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Listen to you?

102
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I always trusted you

103
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,000
What else should I listen?

104
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
You told me you went to teach him English

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,300
I talked to Phun already

106
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
He told me otherwise

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
And now this

108
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Pin!

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can I still trust you?

110
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,500
Stop it

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,300
Listen to me

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Listen to you

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If I do something wrong, why don’t you tell me?

114
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Why don’t you tell me?

115
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
You promised me

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
If we face any obstacles

117
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
We have to tell each other

118
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Stop it

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Stop it?

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
You want me to stop?

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let’s end our relationship then

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let’s stop it

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Pin!

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Listen to me

126
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I lied to you. I’m sorry

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn’t teach Noh English

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I went to learn how to play guitar from him

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You might not believe me

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
But I want you to know this

131
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
I feel so sorry about this

132
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
I’m sorry

133
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Can I give this present to my boyfriend first?

134
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
And you can go wherever you want

135
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I’m sorry

136
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,000
Happy Birthday

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
I wish you all the happiness

138
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,500
You can break up with me

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,500
But I want to tell you this

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I’m sorry
