(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,439
Yes. Finding the one you're destined to be with.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,400
Here's a prince wearing a crown.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,000
And a man with six-pack abs.

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,920
A man who enjoys life and lives an affluent lifestyle.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,160
And a successful man who's been working very hard.

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,920
Who would you want to be with?

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,118
If you were to ask me, I'd say, "The one who's good to me."

(Episode 4: Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo)

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,159
Oh, my! Who knew I'd experience an encounter like this too?

11
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,679
(A big guy!)

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,920
"A big guy?"

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,200
Oh, no!

14
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,159
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,158
I got curious and peeked at it because you threw yourself at me...

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,280
to grab it.

17
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,719
I guess I'm not allowed to read it.

18
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,719
"A big guy?"

19
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,079
It's not what you think.

20
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,319
Then can I read it?

21
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,079
No.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,120
I was just kidding.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,680
I suddenly wanted to tease you when I saw you get all shy.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,799
Sorry. I know we just met.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,079
But your button fell off. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,120
Don't worry about it. I can sew it back on.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,480
He's rich and nice!

28
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,760
A man like this actually exists?

29
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,760
He's majestic but cute!

30
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,159
He's manly and delicate at the same time.

31
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,400
This marvellous man creates harmony out of disharmony.

32
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,319
Mission Possible!

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,039
Perhaps, this man...

34
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,719
was sent to me because the universe has granted my wish.

35
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,530
It's your first time here, right?

36
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,159
I'll show you around.

37
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,639
One moment, please.

38
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,399
Young Bae, I'll do it.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,839
But Mr. Moon won't let you do it if it's a guy.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,279
No, you're wrong. He said I could do it from now on.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,479
- Really? - Yes.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,879
I see.

43
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,759
I don't believe you.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,999
Do you have trust issues? I'm going to punch you, seriously.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
He said I could do it.

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,919
Hello, boss.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
"Boss?"

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,639
You'll show him around?

49
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,639
Tell Young Bae to do it.

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,598
Why are you going back on your word?

51
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,360
You said I could begin my official duties as of today.

52
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,439
I'd appreciate it if she could show me around.

53
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,639
We've already become friends.

54
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,519
Is this guy also sensing that we're meant to be?

55
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,679
But I have to say,

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,199
he looks so young.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,439
Am I going to marry a child?

58
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,610
But he's way too tall...

59
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,959
to be called a child!

60
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

61
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,399
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?

62
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,758
I'm 30.

63
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,519
I thought you were 20! My gosh.

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,279
These days, looking young gives you power.

65
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,050
What's your secret to looking so young?

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,920
Drinking and smoking.

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,279
I do both.

68
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,839
I guess my hormones only affect my body and not my face.

69
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,359
"Hormones?" You're very smart.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,759
I'm a filmmaker,

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,878
so I've been through a lot.

72
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,519
Oh, you're a filmmaker?

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Yes.

74
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm Director Baek Do Hong.

75
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,199
Director Baek Do Hong?

76
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,599
The youngest winner...

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,399
of the Best Director Award at the White Dragon Film Festival?

78
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,639
Oh, you know about me.

79
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,439
You must be very interested in films.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,519
I'm a huge fan!

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,120
I want to take a little break and rest,

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,359
and this place was recommended to me.

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
I see.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,800
But I heard it was very difficult to be a member.

85
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,479
The people with the resort membership were all allowed to join,

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
and we're not accepting new members at the moment.

87
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,839
But...

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,919
special exceptions can be made for those with VIP invitations.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,839
Since I never received an invitation,

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,959
I should just wait indefinitely.

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
Yes, I guess.

92
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,680
You see, I can't wait indefinitely.

93
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,120
I should look for someplace else.

94
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,600
No, wait!

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,279
I'll see what I can do to make a special exception for you.

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,959
Do Hong.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,199
You are my "Very Important Person."

98
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,040
My wish note is your invitation!

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,079
So, you really are letting Jae Rim work here starting today.

100
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,599
I told you. I have no interest in her whatsoever.

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,639
That's great.

102
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,040
I can't wait to see her become Cinderella and leave.

103
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,160
Will you keep barging into my office?

104
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,600
Stop coming here.

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
- Hello. - Hello.

106
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,398
Can we talk later unless it's important?

107
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,959
It's okay. Go ahead and speak.

108
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,680
The man you saw earlier, Baek Do Hong. Can he be a member?

109
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,439
What if I say no? I'm very selective as to whom we accept.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Put him on the waiting list.

111
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
Come on. He's not some riffraff.

112
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,119
He's a famous filmmaker.

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,159
Chungdam Heaven is a cultural society.

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Who suits this place better than him?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
I agree with her. He's a filmmaker.

116
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,680
Jae Rim, you seem very enthusiastic about this.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,839
I suppose you really like that filmmaker guy.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Yes.

119
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,680
If we just let him go now,

120
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,159
I'll cry while sleeping and eating.

121
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,199
I'll cry nonstop every single day right next to you, Mr. Moon.

122
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,600
We have to talk about work, so get going.

123
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,199
Okay.

124
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,920
My honey and I had a great conversation earlier,

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,519
so I'll get going now.

126
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Why should I accept him?

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,759
And what's wrong with you? Are you feeling sick?

128
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,680
Earlier, you told me...

129
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,319
I'd never become Cinderella no matter how hard I tried.

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,639
Don't belittle me for no reason. Why don't we give this a shot...

131
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,720
and see if I can do it or not?

132
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,160
You really are...

133
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,399
incredibly shallow and have no shame.

134
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,359
Or you don't care because I've already seen it all?

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
I am embarrassed too, you see.

136
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,639
I want to live elegantly too.

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,330
But I'd end up with nothing if I lived like that.

138
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,519
You are such a nuisance.

139
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,639
Do whatever you want, but I ask you...

140
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,240
to please leave me alone.

141
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,000
So, is that a yes?

142
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes. I'll let him join,

143
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,330
but I want you both out of my sight, right now.

144
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,960
Thank you!

145
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,559
Oh, no! My gosh.

146
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,209
- Are you all right? - In moments like this,

147
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,720
- Yes. - female protagonists...

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,239
trip and fall on flat ground.

149
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
I should do the same and fall into his arms,

150
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,090
but I have such strong legs.

151
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,120
Won't something happen?

152
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,450
- So? Is he a member now? - Yes.

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,758
I signed him up right away, before you could change your mind.

154
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,919
He's leaving now.

155
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,450
Thank you for making a special exception for me.

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,960
If you're done, get going already.

157
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,639
(Chungdam Heaven)

158
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,960
Mr. Moon, why are you following us?

159
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,799
Hey, Shin Jae Rim. I told you that you stink.

160
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,279
Get away from me!

161
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,559
Jae Rim, you smell nice.

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
What?

163
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,120
Hey, don't eat your hair.

164
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
"Hey, don't eat your hair."

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Jae Rim.

166
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,450
Eat this instead of your hair.

167
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,240
Thanks to you, I could join Chungdam Heaven.

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll buy you more delicious things from now on.

169
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,320
This isn't candy.

170
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,879
It's love.

171
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,960
No, I think you're getting way ahead of yourself.

172
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,679
All right. Then I'll see you at the welcome party.

173
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
See you at the party.

174
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,879
See you at the party.

175
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,959
No, you won't see him at the party.

176
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,158
Why not? I should be at the welcome party since I'm an Angel Manager.

177
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,279
You need to separate your personal feelings from work.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,279
- Do you think I'm a pushover? - That's exactly why...

179
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,159
I'm telling you that I'll work hard, with all my heart.

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,959
Can you tie back your hair before you start working?

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,039
What are you, a virgin ghost?

182
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,159
That's what I would've become, had it not been for your help.

183
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,559
What are you saying?

184
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,200
Prince Cha Min, whose motto was to think of women as lifeless stones,

185
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,600
is now turning into a fainthearted prince,

186
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,159
whose heart flutters at the sight of Jae Rim.

187
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Hey, hurry up.

188
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,320
There's something you need to do before the party.

189
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
What?

190
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Replace all the paintings with new ones.

191
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,200
Place a new order.

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,600
He's acting like Cinderella's mean stepmother.

193
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,559
Well, why do we need new paintings for the party?

194
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,239
Is Baek Do Hong such a big deal?

195
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,119
Why do we have to throw a party to introduce him?

196
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
I know it's a tradition we follow every time we have a new member.

197
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Whatever, I don't want to do it.

198
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,200
We'll also host an exhibition with a new theme.

199
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,840
What kind of theme?

200
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,039
"Wrongful Encounter."

201
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,758
Okay. I'll work promptly to help you.

202
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,119
So? What do you need me to do?

203
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Help me? What do you mean? You'll do everything by yourself.

204
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,879
You signed him up because you like him.

205
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,639
So, to gain the right to attend the party,

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,879
you must fill up this exhibition space.

207
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,039
What?

208
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,479
I'll put you in touch with an artist.

209
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,558
(Artist D, Free-spirited Painter)

210
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,720
So, it'll be very easy.

211
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,439
Boss, art isn't something...

212
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,878
you can whip up on the fly as if you just have to click "print."

213
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,919
You know that.

214
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,039
Hey, you... Can you please...

215
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,919
just do as I say?

216
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,240
Look at him walking away boastfully with that umbrella of his.

217
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,879
Just focus on your goal and calm down.

218
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,360
That umbrella, seriously.

219
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,279
Hey, do you want to steal that umbrella with me?

220
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,840
You'll get in big trouble for that.

221
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,679
It's not just an umbrella. It's Chairman Ko.

222
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,320
Chairman Ko?

223
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,759
Then could it be...

224
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,960
The family's good-luck umbrella is now yours.

225
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,639
Luck is a man's greatest weapon.

226
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,039
Thank you.

227
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,158
The wealthy family's good-luck charm that's been passed down...

228
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,600
for generations?

229
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,559
How about I borrow it, then?

230
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,799
As if he'll let you borrow it.

231
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,759
Gosh.

232
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,559
But Mr. Moon has never approved someone to join the club so quickly.

233
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,360
I wonder what he's thinking.

234
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,679
I was surprised that he hired Jae Rim in the first place.

235
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't even care to know what he's thinking.

236
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,719
Right now, my priority is to figure out...

237
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,519
how I'm going to prepare for this new exhibition.

238
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,679
We'll help you when Mr. Moon isn't around.

239
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,879
Hurry up and contact that artist first.

240
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,600
- Really? - Yes.

241
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,480
I can't believe someone is willing to help me!

242
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,120
I'll take you out for a nice meal later.

243
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,200
Hey, Jae Rim.

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,840
You think you can get away with an empty promise?

245
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,279
What?

246
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,519
Well, let me think.

247
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,479
Yes, pizza! I'm craving pizza.

248
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
How about we have some pizza and talk?

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,720
(Eat Pizza)

250
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,679
Pizza Margherita. One of these and...

251
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,679
Triple Cheese for me.

252
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,559
With extra cheese on top. Okay.

253
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,759
Enjoy.

254
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Oh, our food is ready.

255
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,919
Hey, we should eat together.

256
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
I want to eat this on the way.

257
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,359
It's convenient because you can hold it in one hand and eat it.

258
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,678
Hey, how long is it?

259
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,279
It's really big for one serving.

260
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,159
- Here. - Nice!

261
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,600
Nothing for you.

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
It looks so good.

263
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,759
The pizza here is really good.

264
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,039
(Hwaryong Hapkido)

265
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,080
Seriously, what's with people?

266
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,240
They're thoughtless and have no fear.

267
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,119
Even your long time friend can betray you.

268
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,679
How could she like someone she just met?

269
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,480
Who is letting his anger take over him right now?

270
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,878
It is your mind that decides...

271
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,599
whether you can overcome the 108 temptations.

272
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,519

And now, he's seeing things.

274
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,039
Everything is created by the mind alone!

275
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,279
You're all talk.

276
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,879
I am your teacher.

277
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,638
- You picked a nice one. - Yes.

278
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,440
- It's nicer than I thought. - Let me see.

279
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,518
Hello.

280
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,678
What is this, a guerilla attack?

281
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,519
You can't schedule a meeting all of a sudden like this.

282
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,120
Gosh.

283
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,120
It is like a guerilla exhibition.

284
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm sorry, but we're tight on time, and we need many pieces.

285
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,519
You expect me to do as you say because I'm an emerging artist?

286
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,720
You must think it's unfair.

287
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,959
Then use this exhibition as an opportunity to become famous!

288
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,410
We can pay you very well.

289
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,598
But would you be able to fill the space by yourself?

290
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,410
Yes, of course! I'm a genius.

291
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,278
- Yes, a genius. - A genius.

292
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,920
He's a genius.

293
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,839
What's going on?

294
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,680
Why is everyone with her?

295
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,758
Encounters you never want to experience in life.

296
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,960
There are times when we experience such wrongful encounters.

297
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,359
Like the fire-chicken ramyeon.

298
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,410
It's painful after you eat it, but you can't stop eating it.

299

Mint chocolate chip ice cream is another example!

What? You call that art?

301
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,650
I can't do that.

302
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,240
It's not like there are set answers in art.

303
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,409
Let's not think too much.

304
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,440
You know, just do it.

305
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,319
I mean, you're a genius. You can do anything. Right, guys?

306
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,559
What if I cancel the whole thing?

307
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,319

I'm going away for a bit to rest.

Where are you going? Namyangju? Or Kyoto?

This has never happened to me before.

Hey, why... Why are you eating that?

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,649
It's not an ordinary lollipop!

331
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,839
Who said you could have this? You greedy pig!

332
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,599
What? "Greedy pig?"

333
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,919
Hey, come here. I'll drill ten lollipops into your head.

334
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,519
- You ate my lollipop, you pig! - Come here!

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,359
Careful. Please take it out carefully.

336
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,839
Thank you.

337
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,920
Oh, my.

338
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,999
He didn't even have much time.

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,650
This looks pretty good.

340
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,319
Oh, it's nice.

341
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,359
By the way, how come our overbearing boss isn't here today?

342
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,039
Did he lose Chairman Ko or something?

343
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,519
He said he didn't want to be here today.

344
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
What?

345
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
It looks pretty good.

346
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,759
He can slack off without shame because he's the CEO.

347
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,200
What am I supposed to do if he isn't here after what he said?

348
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,720
After dumping all this work on me.

349
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,558
He told me I stink...

350
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,518
and belittled me saying I'd never become Cinderella.

351
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,758
How could he treat me so badly?

352
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,920
I am a woman too.

353
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,920
What is with that woman?

354
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,679
She treats me like a pushover.

355
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,798
Does she think I'm that easy? Does she think I'm a total joke?

356
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,169
He needs to watch what he says.

357
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,518
He'd suddenly flip out and tell me to get out of his sight.

358
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,118
Didn't he say I was fun to be around?

359
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,559
What am I, a paper doll?

360
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,720
Bending over backwards at his whim?

361
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,000
She's so flighty.

362
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,649
She fell for a man she'd just met...

363
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,920
and demanded that I accept him.

364
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,200
She always does whatever she wants.

365
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,409
He is the boss, but so what?

366
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,960
Why doesn't she just run the club, then?

367
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,960
I can't stand how petty he is. I'll quit as soon as I can.

368
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,279
Gosh, whatever. I hope she quits soon.

369
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,038
("Ill, But Once Again")

370
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,079
Oh, no.

371
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,359
Hey!

372
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,479
Busted.

373
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,960
- You jerk! - My goodness.

374
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,650
You can do everything once I'm dead.

375
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,960
What nonsense.

376
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,240
You can date around all you want once I die.

377
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,720
- My gosh. - What did you say?

378
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,079
I could never do this if not now.

379
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,599
I...

380
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
He'll collapse.

381
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,399
He really is dying. My gosh.

382
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,599
- He'll die soon. - I want to love all I want.

383
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,359
Leave us alone so we can love each other!

384
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,240
- Isn't he his doctor? - My goodness.

385
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,839
- That doctor... - My gosh!

386
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,839
They're kissing next to each other?

387
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,960
I knew it. Kudos to me for deciding not to get married.

388
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,319
No.

389
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,959
Happy marriages do exist,

390
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
although it may not be your first marriage.

391
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,599
(Gu Nam Hoon)

392
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,480
Hey, my future sister-in-law. She said no.

393
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,680
Gosh. Maybe I should've bought a grape-sized diamond.

394
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
I don't think the size is the issue.

395
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Soo Jin doesn't care about stuff like that.

396
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,880
Well, then what should I do now?

397
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,559
Why are you asking me?

398
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,240
If she said no, that's that.

399
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,079
You can't do this to me.

400
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,079
If you ditch me now, you'll have real problems.

401
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,200
Can you pay me back right away?

402
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,559
Don't be so petty!

403
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,240
Hey, Soo Jin.

404
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,000
- I'm home. - Hey, you.

405
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,199
So...

406
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,279
please just tell me what your sister likes.

407
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,880
- Did you have dinner? - No.

408
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,640
Gosh, I'm hungry.

409
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,599
Really? What do you feel like?

410
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,079
- For Soo Jin... - Anything.

411
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,959
- Mom's her favourite person. - How about that?

412
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay.

413
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,079
So, be good to Mom.

414
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Who knew I'd forget this face?

415
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,400
I have to say,

416
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,880
Shin Jae Rim looks like her.

417
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,839
Now, I know...

418
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,240
why I'm drawn to Shin Jae Rim...

419
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,680
and why I can't stand her at the same time.

420
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,559
She has a man who watches out for her...

421
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,559
while manoeuvring this precarious thing called life.

422
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
Do Hong.

423
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,079
Don't come down.

424
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,079
My goodness. Does he really have to hold her like that?

425
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,039
Sometimes, it's necessary to overreact in romantic situations.

426
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,519
- Jae Rim. - Yes?

427
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,480
- Are you all right? - Yes.

428
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,720
- I'll clean this. - Thanks.

429
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
He held me in his arms.

430
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,160
Was he really sent to me by the universe?

431
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,359
Aren't you working too hard to prepare for the party?

432
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,640
I should do my best since it's your party.

433
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
But still, you should take a break here and there.

434
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,880
Shall I?

435
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,559
Then how about a drink?

436
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,039
Sounds good.

437
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,759
I'd love to have a mojito while admiring your beautiful eyes.

438
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,640
You're welcome to have two!

439
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,480
Then please give me a moment.

440
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,559
I can't do this anymore. Sorry!

441
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,920
Why now? Did he have to ruin this romantic moment?

442
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,279
Where is he? Where did he go?

443
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,880
That boss jerk. I bet he recommended him, knowing he'd pull this on me.

444
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Stay away.

445
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,119
Hey, let's talk.

446
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,279
Leave me alone, will you?

447
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,358
An artist needs to go into his cave at times to have some alone time.

448
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,160
Come out of the cave now, or it'll turn into your grave. Okay?

449
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,279
Hey! That punk!

450
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
Hey!

451
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,160
- Darn it. - Hey! Stop!

452
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
Gosh, seriously.

453
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,920
When I see someone running away,

454
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,559
I instinctively want to catch them, like a dog.

455
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,599
I really will bite you once I catch you!

456
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
In the end, she utilized her tools and managed to catch him.

457
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,119
Why run away? I said we should talk.

458
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,000
My feet hurt.

459
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Gosh, I miss the time when I could paint whatever I wanted.

460
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,720
(Supermarket)

461
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,799
Getting paid and being told what to paint. I hate it now.

462
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
I'll quit being an artist.

463
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,680
Hey. I get it, but don't quit.

464
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
When you like something, you should never give up.

465
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,038
If you give up, you'll regret it forever.

466
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,119
Are you talking about yourself?

467
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,599
Yes.

468
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,039
So make sure you protect what you like even if it's hard.

469
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,640
Gosh, I really hate it.

470
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,518
This darned world.

471
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,319
Yes. Swear all you want and just do it.

472
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,838
Become successful in this disgusting world.

473
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,758
Then you can be free, like a bird!

474
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,839
How nice is that?

475
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,479
Like a bird, my foot.

476
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,920
Spoken like a true boomer.

477
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,599
Forget it.

478
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,119
Tonight, I will burn myself instead of you.

479
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
My gosh.

480
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,519
My skills have gotten a little rusty, but this isn't bad.

481
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,720
I should've kept at it instead of giving up.

482
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,519
But my other dreams are about to come true, so it's fine.

483
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,039
In any case, I will find my happiness.

484
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,599
How did you find me here?

485
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,200
There was something I wanted to tell you, so I tracked you down.

486
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,119
Hey, you really have no fear.

487
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,319
How could you come here?

488
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,319
Why should I be afraid of you?

489
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Why?

490
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,799
Hey, I'm going easy on you.

491
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,799
I'm holding back, and it isn't easy.

492
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Why should you hold back?

493
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,119
I don't like your dreams.

494
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,519
I don't like the idea of you dating Baek Do Hong,

495
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,559
and I hate you.

496
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,559
Then what do you want me to do?

497
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,119
Shall I just disappear?

498
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,440
Can't you just admit that you like me?

499
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,480
Shall I help you?

500
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,240
Was that a dream?

501
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,960
This wasn't the kind of "wrongful encounter" I was talking about.

502
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,160
Then what is it?

503
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,960
Give me an example at least, although it's too late.

504
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,079
It is too late now, but...

505
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,359
Like you and me?

506
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
Anyway, why did you work so hard on this exhibition?

507
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,200
Because of him? Or are you naturally a hard worker?

508
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,119
Well, I don't really excel at anything though.

509
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,279
Are you dumb?

510
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,440
You did all this.

511
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,679
I wish you had done something meaningful...

512
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
with such determination...

513
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,880
instead of joining this place with impure intentions.

514
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,279
All right. A promise is a promise.

515
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,000
You may attend the party.

516
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,078
I hope you achieve your impure goals and leave this place soon.

517
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,119
I will.

518
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,519
Hold on.

519
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,319
Are you rooting for me?

520
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,559
Or do you just hate me?

521
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,920
Take this off.

522
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,200
I really couldn't hold back anymore if you stayed here.

523
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,559
Make sure you look nice if you're attending the party.

524
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,480
The party will start at night.

525
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Oh, I see.

526
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,240
The "Wrongful Encounter" party has now begun.

527
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,039
(Fire Chicken With Beef Tripe)

528
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,960
There are so many things that are wrong here.

529
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
(Chocolate-Covered Chicken)

530
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,519
Weird combinations are made weirder.

531
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,759
People who don't like them are so put off by them,

532
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,000
while those who like them can't get enough of them.

533
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,119
They're such special encounters.

534
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,480
I gave her permission to attend the party, but she's not even here yet.

535
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,440
Will she show up dressed to the nines?

536
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,119
Here comes the slave.

537
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,119
Oh, my. The slave looks stunning dressed up.

538
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:12,039
Now, I can't even tell who is a slave.

539
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
Found him.

540
00:34:58,769 --> 00:34:59,769
My man.

541
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:24,679
This exhibition was put together in such a hurry.

542
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,239
Everything looks kind of weird, right?

543
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,559
Fearless and savage. The work of a genius.

544
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,880
It's very raw. I like it.

545
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:39,079
Especially this piece. I can feel the emotions.

546
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,559
Can I tell you a secret?

547
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
This is my painting.

548
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,809
Can I tell you a secret too?

549
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,329
Next time, paint a portrait of me.

550
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,960
Is this how I would feel...

551
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,639
when my dreams do come true?

552
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:11,519
You're Director Baek Do Hong, the man of the hour.

553
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,809
I'm Ri Na.

554
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,809
The daughter of the Hyosung Electronics family.

555
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,809
Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you.

556
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,518
Director Baek, I'm so happy to know that we're both members...

557
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,809
of Chungdam Heaven.

558
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,159
Who invited you to join the club?

559
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,518
No one invited him.

560
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,440
This new manager here strongly recommended him.

561
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:31,159
She practically begged her boss to let him join Chungdam Heaven.

562
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,329
Oh, I see. I didn't know that could be done.

563
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:36,808
Is something going on between you two?

564
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:37,840
No.

565
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,880
I met her here.

566
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,719
But she put in so much effort to help me, so I'm grateful.

567
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,360
I see.

568
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,400
I wonder why she did that.

569
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,559
Don't tell me you have an ulterior motive.

570
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,718
Like your predecessor who foolishly thought that she could...

571
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,920
become Cinderella too.

572
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,519
Why not? It is possible.

573
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,400
I really don't understand people who think that way.

574
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:07,329
They should just come and work for my family if they need money.

575
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,769
Hey, I can pay you very well.

576
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,440
Do you want to be my housekeeper?

577
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,360
No.

578
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,599
I'll work hard here.

579
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,079
Really?

580
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,679
Then get me another drink.

581
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,809
Sure.

582
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,880
I am embarrassed of my unrealistic dreams.

583
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:39,239
But without such dreams,

584
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,159
I'd live like this for the rest of my life.

585
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,289
Yes, I just need to make Baek Do Hong mine.

586
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,119
Here's your drink.

587
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,440
Did I say I wanted the mint chocolate flavour?

588
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,039
I really hate this!

589
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,638
When you're falling,

590
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,880
you instinctively hold on to whatever you can grab,

591
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,239
so no one can criticize her for this.

592
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,039
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

593
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,239
My gosh! What is this?

594
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,239
Seriously! What is the matter with you?

595
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,079
I'm sorry. I apologize.

596
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,639
Gosh, I can't believe this.

597
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:45,440
Just tell her to clean this up and let it go.

598
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,639
I think it was a mistake.

599
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,960
You're living like a loser because you make mistakes like this.

600
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,039
I can't believe I thought he was the one I was meant to be with.

601
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,199
This is where...

602
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm meant to be, rock bottom.

603
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,809
Why did you make a mistake like this?

604
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,360
Mistakes like this will pile up and turn into a serious problem.

605
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:54,960
I like...

606
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,400
the mint chocolate flavour.

607
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,159
My gosh. Did he just...

608
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,119
confess his feelings to her?

609
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,519
Prince Cha Min got slapped for his confession made at the wrong time.

610
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,769
Prince Cha Min and our newderella have now woken up.

611
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,440
What will happen to them now?

612
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,840
I'll tell you all about it next time.
