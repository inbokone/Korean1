7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Hey,

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,100
which one is correct here? Is it "a" or "the?"

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,500
Hey. We went over this yesterday.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,300
I know.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,039
But articles are so tricky.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,409
Darn it.

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,979
It doesn't have a license plate.

14
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,289
Hey. Hold her.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,899
What are you going to do with her?

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,500
We were ordered to get her.

17
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,109
Is this an abduction?

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,219
Hey. Don't mind those punks. Just close the door.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,120
Close the door before she falls out of the car!

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,230
Hey!

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Darn it.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,840
Are you all right?

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,120
As expected, a robust adult overpowers me in terms of strength.

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,659
Ma'am, wake up.

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,969
Move.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Darn in.

27
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,719
Hey, Se Kyung!

28
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,719
Darn it. You idiot.

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
You little punk. Do you want to die?

30
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
Hey, you...

31
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,930
Is there anything you're good at besides studying?

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,469
At looking good?

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,340
You don't look good anymore.

34
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,840
You should learn to protect yourself first. Okay?

35

(High School Return of a Gangster)

36
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,888
She had been sleeping...

37
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,629
after taking sleeping pills before those guys came.

38
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,030
She is still not walking up because she's deep in her sleep.

39
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,228
The doctor said she wasn't injured.

40
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,129
So there's nothing to worry about.

41
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,710
She can go home tomorrow, so I'll sleep here tonight.

42
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:56,870
Yi Heon and Se Kyung, you should hurry home now.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,479
You have school tomorrow.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,750
No, I'll stay here tonight.

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,180
You should go home and get some sleep.

46
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,849
Let's get you treated so that you can go home.

47
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,590
Your father must be worried about you.

48
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,460
Excuse me.

49
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,800
Here.

50
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,569
Which one of you is Song Yi Heon?

51
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Gosh.

52
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,110
Thanks for your hard work day and night.

53
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,838
Seeing detectives here,

54
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,079
the case must've been transferred to the Violent Crimes Unit.

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,578
Do you have a relative who's a cop?

56
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,750
You know a lot for a student.

57
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,549
Because you came straight to the hospital,

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,379
the police at the precinct couldn't question the victims.

59
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,819
So we need to talk about the incident.

60
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,389
Then, why don't you get some gukbap with this?

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,138
Get some gukbap with this money.

62
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,610
Get your wounds treated...

63
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,339
and go home safely.

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,219
Detectives, why don't we talk...

65
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,420
- somewhere else? - Sure.

66
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,860
Does your mother have any enemies?

67
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,769
No, she doesn't.

68
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,100
Is there anyone around her who would do this?

69
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,139
Maybe a man who followed her around or a stalker?

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
There is one. Lee Mi Kyung.

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,809
I heard the chairman's wife was nearing death.

72
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,680
You must be scared that my mother might take...

73
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,149
her place as his legal wife.

74
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,019
Detectives.

75
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,889
It wasn't an abduction.

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,389
It was...

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,429
It was a definitely premeditated crime...

78
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,269
where Lee Mi Kyung sent people to get rid of my mother.

79
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,110
It was...

80
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,179
a simple incident involving a parking issue.

81
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
What?

82
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,948
Some street thugs tried to park in front of my house.

83
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,819
When they were stopped, they picked a fight. That's all.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,430
She came out because of the noise and fainted.

85
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,328
What?

86
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:32,259
They didn't put her in the van to kidnap her?

87
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,730
No.

88
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,768
Because she fainted,

89
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,698
we laid her down in the van for a moment.

90
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,670
The first person who called in...

91
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,639
said gangsters in black masks kidnapped a woman in a van.

92
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,008
They said they saw them put her in the car.

93
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,709
Gosh. They must have misinterpreted it.

94
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,620
So, I'm wondering if we can...

95
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,290
withdraw the initial report made to the police on this case?

96
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,459
It's too weird to see it as a simple housebreaking.

97
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,290
Why would they abandon the van if they had nothing to hide?

98
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,660
They smelled terribly like alcohol.

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,230
So, some street thugs...

100
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,970
parked wrongfully in front of one's house after drinking.

101
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,500
That's not worth the time of the police.

102
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,139
What? Maybe it was a wrong report.

103
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,778
We'll check the case again...

104
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,910
based on your statement and get back to you.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,778
If it turns out to be an abduction, it'll become a criminal case.

106
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,949
Then, we'll investigate it even though you withdrew it.

107
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,050
I got it.

108
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,169
Why did you cancel the report to the police?

109
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,439
We have to find out who did it and catch the perps.

110
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,850
They were no street thugs.

111
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,449
Isn't it more dangerous if we cancel the report?

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,969
If the police look into them,

117
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,529
they'll find out about Lee Mi Kyung.

118
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,639
In the end, the police will find out she works for Chairman Bae.

119
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,009
Then the world will find out that Song Yi Heon is...

120
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,110
Chairman Bae's illegitimate child.

121
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,579
Why did you withdraw the report?

122
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,050
If the police get involved,

123
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,180
Yi Heon's life will change drastically.

124
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,049
That won't be good for Yi Heon at all.

125
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,730
Don't worry.

126
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,559
Nothing bad will happen to Yi Heon.

127
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

128
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,940
It's awkward that Yi Heon talks about himself...

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,370
in the third person.

130
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm also curious about who you are.

131
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,080
Are you going to let this incident go, then?

132
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,519
No way.

133
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,549
They might do something terrible if we leave them alone.

134
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,889
I'm going to punish them in my own way.

135
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,090
Like I always have.

136
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,629
Gosh.

137
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:22,129
But I'm worried more about your face than about them.

138
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,039
My face? What about it?

139
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,638
Avoid running into your family at home.

140

Put on some raw meat and roll an egg around it.

141

Eggs do the magic when treating bruises.

142
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,279
Darn it.

143
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,990
- Goodness. - That hurts.

144
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,860
So, you took a stroll from the study room,

145
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,428
and some street thugs that you'd never seen before...

146
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,399
came out of nowhere and beat you up?

147
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,029
And you couldn't see their faces because it was dark.

148
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,169
You're right.

149
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,179
Let's go.

150
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,408
When you go back to where it happened,

151
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,850
you'll remember their faces.

152
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,319
We never know.

153
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,950
They might come back to the crime scene.

154
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,059
Is this where you got beat up?

155
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,440
There are no security cameras around here.

156
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,600
There aren't many people passing by.

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,940
There is no car around, so we can't check dashcam videos.

158
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,250
These street thugs were so meticulous,

159
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,750
weren't they?

160
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,299
Did you forget that your father was a prosecutor?

161
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,740
I don't see any traces of people's movement...

162
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,939
on this dirt ground.

163
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,110
The ground is undisturbed.

164
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,038
As for the grass over there, it's nice and flat...

165
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,779
as if no one has walked on it, let alone fought on it.

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,620
Why did you lie to me again?

167
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,190
What's gotten into you these days?

168
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,389
Did you get in a fight, or did someone beat you?

169
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,460
This is why I installed the tracking app on your phone.

170
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,169
I should know whatever you're doing.

171
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,299
It's all for your own good.

172
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,840
Why can't you see that? Why?

173
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,178
What are you going to do in the future...

174
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,610
for you to act so carelessly?

175
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,049
Hey!

176
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,419
Se Kyung!

177
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,830
(General Ward A)

178
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,470
(Se Kyung's Mom)

179
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes.

180
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,710
I heard Se Kyung collapsed. What happened?

181
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,139
Is he ill?

182
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,178
It was just temporary dizziness caused by stress.

183
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,049
He has to be on an IV for a few hours,

184
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,580
so he's in the hospital.

185
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,820
He'll get diagnosed again tomorrow morning before we go home.

186
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,090
"Stress?"

187
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,159
Did you lash out at him again?

188
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,330
You are always so harsh on him.

189
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,959
Gosh. Can't you let him be a normal high school kid?

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,970
Am I doing this for myself?

191
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,139
It's for his own good.

192
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,699
I'm doing this so that he won't go astray...

193
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,740
and become a good person.

194
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,908
It's amazing that he has followed you this much.

195
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,279
He's a good kid already.

196
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,879
I'm going back to Korea after this business trip.

197
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,019
Stop roasting him!

198
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,279
When you always protect others,

199
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,850
I can't even protect myself.

200
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,070
(Please withdraw the case above.)

201
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,339
It didn't feel right, so I checked.

202
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,940
And the van was an illegal one.

203
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Are you sure it was some mistake by the street thugs?

204
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,250
Yes, I am.

205
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,850
I guess street thugs these days...

206
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,149
even drive illegal cars.

207
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,388
I wanted to check their faces at least,

208
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,159
but the security cameras at your house were broken down.

209
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,119
I don't know who they are...

210
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,758
because I couldn't identify their faces.

211
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,558
Since no damage was done,

212
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm withdrawing the reported case as you asked.

213
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,599
If anything comes up in your mind, contact us right away.

214
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,969
Tell your parents and fix the security cameras.

215
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes.

216
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,079
Okay. Bye.

217

(Violent Crimes Team 1)

218
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,220
So, they broke in with a thorough plan.

219
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,929
Okay, Lee Mi Kyung.

220
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,600
You're challenging me to a duel, aren't you?

221
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,440
Is this OK Construction?

222
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,110
Can I talk to Lee Mi Kyung in the secretary's office?

223
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,080
We don't have anyone named Lee Mi Kyung.

224
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,090
I'm certain she works for Chairman Bae.

225
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,590
Should I pay a visit to the company?

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Should I go there and announce Yi Heon is Chairman Bae's son?

227
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,440
She won't be much help in that state.

228
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,240
It must have been tough for Yi Heon.

229
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,110
I'm starting to understand...

230
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,509
why you were feeling so helpless.

231
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,519
You don't have Lee Mi Kyung's phone number, either?

232
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,418
You're right.

233
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,789
Doesn't she deposit your monthly pay and all that?

234
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,388
The money comes under the name OK Construction.

235
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,159
We are registered as its employees.

236
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,229
Gosh. I did come here...

237
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,230
after Ms. Lee contacted me.

238
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,169
It was Ms. Lee's doing, wasn't it?

239
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,870
Gosh. It's terrifying.

240
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,740
She has spitefulness in her eyes.

241
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,508
Ever since she started coming here,

242
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,149
your mom couldn't live without alcohol and sleeping pills.

243
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,850
Her condition has gotten worse.

244
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,619
I don't know her number either.

245
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,960
She contacts me once every two weeks unilaterally...

246
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,330
and asks how you and your mother are doing.

247
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,859
Let me see the number she calls you from.

248
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,940
(Secretary Lee of OK Construction)

249
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,910
The number you have dialed does not exist.

250
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,740
Please check the number and call again.

251
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,180
I can neither get in touch with her nor meet with her.

252
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,920
But Lee Mi Kyung knows everything about me...

253
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,319
from where I am, what I'm up to, and the food and drinks I buy.

254
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,890
Tightening the security won't do much.

255
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,400
If they were to come back here, they would get their way.

256
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,740
Where on earth were they planning to take his mother?

257
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,069
If I could find those guys,

258
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,339
it would be helpful.

259
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,960
You said this was your specialty.

260
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,789
But you failed to abduct a mere woman.

261
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,089
One of your underlings ran away in the middle of the operation.

262
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,759
Seriously?

263
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,700
What if the police find out I was behind this?

265
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,769
I looked into the case through a detective I know.

266
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,609
The report was already withdrawn.

267
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,980
The woman's son is looking for me.

268
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,980
Didn't I tell you?

269
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,880
He stays quiet, hiding his claws.

270
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,420
Then he ambushes you out of the blue.

271
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,349
I will...

272
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,420
take care of this matter. You have my word.

273
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,059
I must teach the kid...

274
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,599
who ran away from the operation the consequence...

275
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,200
of betraying me while I'm at it.

The phone is turned off.

278
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,149
The phone is turned off.

279
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,349
You'll be directed to voicemail after the beep.

280
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,589
Well, Jae Min isn't answering his phone.

281
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,129
Tell him if I don't see him in school tomorrow,

282
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,200
he'll be my dartboard.

283
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,599
Hey.

284
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,069
It's your turn to throw out the recyclables.

285
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,009
You didn't do it last month.

286
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,769
Since it was my turn after you, I did it last month.

287
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,809
I want you to do it this month.

288
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,549
Talk about being brazen.

289
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:45,089
You're breaking the rule. But you don't seem sorry at all.

290
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,960
(Not being embarrassed by breaking the rule)

291
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,859
Come on. Do it.

292
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,059
You little...

293
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,779
What happened to your face?

294
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,579
It's all bruised.

295
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,379
Did you...

296
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,720
Did you have a fight with Hong Jae Min?

297
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,420
Did you crush them or something?

298
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,989
Everyone heard about how Hong Jae Min's crew...

299
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,789
pulled you aside on your way to school a few days ago.

300
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,990
Right. I ended it that day.

301
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,799
By the way, I got this bruise...

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,599
on my way home from the study room a few days ago.

303
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,230
Some thugs picked a fight with me.

304
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,369
- Thugs? - Thugs?

305
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,769
Don't worry. I may not get good grades,

306
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,500
but I'm good at things that involve my body.

307
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,210
Gosh.

308
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,410
I only fear...

309
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,609
the teachers...

310
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,779
and the exam sheets.

311
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,818
I'm totally with him. Whenever I think about the exams,

312
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,118
I want to stop breathing and dive into the Han River.

313
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,719
Whenever I think about how I have to get my grades up,

314
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,018
I totally can't get any sleep.

315
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,190
I'm with you. This is so excruciating.

316
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,528
How about this? Why don't we get...

317
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:00,059
a change of scenery at a sick cafe before the exam?

318
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,130
- Count me in. - Really?

319
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,769
When? I'll burn that day on my calendar.

320
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,440
Do you want to come with us?

321
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,339
Go where?

322
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,109
A sick cafe. What do you say?

323
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,440
- Let's go. - What?

324
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,049
Hey.

325
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,480
We're still students. We can't use such language.

326
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,380
Why would we go to a "sick" cafe?

327
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,019
- What's he going on about? - That's crazy.

328
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,390
What are you talking about?

329
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,960
"Sick" here means "cool." A cool cafe.

330
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,829
What was that?

331
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,230
I mean...

332
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,400
Why did you say "sick" then?

333
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,439
Seriously. He's a caveman incarnate.

334
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,798
Hey. What if he thinks "incarnate" means...

335
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,539
- meat like "carne?" - Hey. You're taking it too far.

336
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,079
- Don't tease him. No. Right? - Come on.

337
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,420
What? Are you for real?

338
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
No way.

339
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,759
I'm sorry. I never had friends.

340
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,690
Please teach me a lot.

341
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,659
Sure. It won't be easy since we're seniors.

342
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,599
But you didn't get to make any friends because of Hong Jae Min.

343
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,569
We'll be your friends starting now.

344
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,069
Yes, buddy.

345
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,809
Don't forget to play soccer with us against the other class. Okay?

346
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,239
This is nice.

347
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,339
Let's be good friends.

348
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,819
Why isn't Se Kyung here? Class is about to start.

349
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,019
You're right.

350
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,990
Is he sick? I hope he's not.

351
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,859
Are you okay?

352
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,489
My parents got very worried when they saw that I got hurt.

353
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,589
So I'm at the hospital.

354
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,400
I woke up too early, so I'm at the library by my house.

355
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,769
What about you? You said you would catch the culprit.

356
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,440
Students must fulfill their duty first.

357
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,240
My goal is to have the perfect attendance.

358
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,569
Is that why you're making Hong Jae Min come to school?

359
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,210
I'm keeping him next to me, so I can straighten him out.

360
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,539
That's an excuse.

361
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,180
You just want him to graduate from high school...

362
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,619
when his parents don't care about that.

363
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,049
How nosy.

364
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,130
You should use this chance and take a few more days off.

365
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,829
Once I get better, I'll go to the study room.

366
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,299
I should help you study.

367
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,829
FR?

368
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
- Do you know what that means? - What?

369
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,369
"For real."

370
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,740
Seriously. Kids these days shorten everything.

371
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,440
Darn it. You guys shorten everything.

372
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,579
Don't overdo it. I'll see you soon.

375

376
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,210

(Deliver it on the same day.)

378
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,299
The fermented skate from Heuksan Island is the best.

379
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,730
I'm glad I got it straight from the island.

380
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,069
I prepared the bossam and the aged kimchi for the pairing.

381
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,039
I'll prepare breakfast now.

382
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,769
I'll be able to focus better on my studies today.

383
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,839
- I'll go and get changed. - Okay.

384
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,750
He doesn't even fermented kimchi.

385
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,318
He wants to eat fermented skate for breakfast?

386
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,349
When I don't even eat that?

387
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,059
Oh, my. Hurting his head must have changed his palate.

388
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,880
Excuse me, sir. Is everything okay here?

389
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,220
I saw a van here a few days ago. It was quite a commotion too.

390
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,990
I was wondering if everything was okay.

391
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,990
Right. I live over there down the block.

392
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,029
I saw the police here too. So I just got curious.

393
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,529
Everything is fine here.

394
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,269
But I know that's not true.

395
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,440
Why is that a secret? Why wouldn't he just tell me?

396
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,940
Gosh. This is driving me crazy. Come on.

397
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,480
Darn it.

398
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,500
Your face looks much better today.

399
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,240
Of course.

400
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,769
I kept rubbing an egg and raw meat on my bruise.

401
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,069
Hey.

402
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,309
What happened here?

403
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,309
Did you bite your nails until they bled?

404
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,249
It's a habit. I can tone it down once I pay more attention.

405
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,220
I doubt it'll get better because you pay more attention.

406
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,059
I had never seen you bite your nails at school or in the study room.

407
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,029
Did something happen...

408
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,460
at your house?

409
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,640
Forget it. Let's go inside and study.

410
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,400
I must make up for the classes I missed the last few days.

411
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,210
You took notes thoroughly, right?

412
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,880
Let's go in.

413
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,319
This is the first time you asked to take a break.

414
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,259
The police will come to our school.

415
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,799
I'm certain he reported it to the police.

416
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,900
What did you say to your parents?

417
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,809
I said I got beaten up by thugs when I was out for a walk.

418
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,579
Did you have to lie because of me?

419
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,880
Because I said it would change Song Yi Heon's life?

420
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,150
No.

421
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,650
If I told the truth...

422
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,420
Nothing.

423
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,930
You should have looked the other way that night like you usually do.

424
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,759
You could barely throw a punch.

425
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,470
I'm sorry that I got you involved...

426
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,630
in this.

427
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,099
Gosh. Don't be sorry.

428
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,839
It's not something you started. It's fine.

429
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,039
So...

430
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,609
are you worried about the police? Is that why you look so down?

431
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,750
Or...

432
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,680
did something really happen?

433
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,630
Yes. Investigator Lee. I got it just now.

434
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:46,400
I know this is a personal favor. Thanks for helping me out.

435
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,599
Yes. Okay.

436
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,440
Let's grab a meal sometime soon. Yes.

437
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:54,599
Okay.

438
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,720
(Personal Information Report, Song Yi Heon)

439
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,890
Here's what I think. The nature of this problem...

440
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,420
lies in your body.

441
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:19,630
We're in this pickle because you can't throw a punch.

442
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,759
That night, you just let him beat you up.

443
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,529
You couldn't even properly protect yourself.

444
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,400
That's why the blows were more damaging to you.

445
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,539
You should learn how to box first.

446
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,009
All right. Here are the offensive techniques in boxing.

447
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,680
Jabs, straights, hooks, and uppercuts.

448
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,720
There are only a few techniques.

449
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,989
You might think I'm simply throwing punches.

450
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,318
But I have to predict my opponent's movement,

451
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,719
come up with a strategy to attack my opponent, and then deliver it.

452
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,089
This sport is about reading your opponent.

453
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,730
Then this doesn't suit you.

454
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,559
It requires a lot of thinking.

455
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,970
There's a physical aspect too.

456
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:03,369
Widen your feet.

457
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,809
It feels awkward at first for everyone.

458
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,279
All right. Keep your fists up under your chin.

459
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,480
- Jab. - Jab.

460
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,119
Go ahead.

461
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,890
- Jab. - Come on. Own it. Jab.

462
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:23,059
- Jab. - That's it. All the way.

463
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,230
Extend your arm more. Extend it all the way. Here.

- One, two. - One, two.

465
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,028
- That's it. Harder. - One, two.

466
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,499
Faster. Harder. One, two.

467
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
One, two.

(Song Yi Heon)

469
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,940
An illegitimate child and an outcast.

470
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,609
He doesn't get good grades either.

471
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,349
They had been in the same class for two years.

472
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,890
He had gotten close to this kid all of a sudden?

473
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Straight.

474
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,599
Hey, you have good power.

475
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,538
Your reflexes aren't so bad.

476
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,099
How come you never exercised?

477
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,710
My father didn't like it.

478
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,579
What kind of parent doesn't like his child to be healthy?

479
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,049
He just doesn't think highly of physical achievements.

480
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,380
Is that so? That's odd.

481
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,990
Did he get hurt badly as a kid when he was exercising?

482
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,089
Hey, you know what?

483
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,829
Gosh.

484
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,730
Hey, that was no joke.

485
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,499
How could you be so quick like that?

486
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,069
Here's a thing about fighting.

487
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,299
Being able to dodge a punch is more important than landing one.

488
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,710
Hey, let's practice this next time.

489
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,279
How to dodge punches without getting punched. Okay?

490
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay.

491
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,508
Can I borrow your science study book?

492
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,219
I need to study that tonight, but I left it at school.

493
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
Can I borrow it just this once?

494
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,650
Sure.

495
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,920
- It's in my house. Let's go in. - Okay.

496
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,769
Song Yi Heon?

497
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,400
What are you doing here?

498
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,970
Do you live here?

499
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,349
Why would you bring another guy...

500
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,750
to a place like this?

501
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,160
I've been craving sweets lately.

502
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,490
- An iced Americano? - Yes.

503
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,829
What do you want to drink?

504
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,569
A hot iced Americano.

505
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,740
Just drink whatever I get for you.

506
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,919
- What? - Gosh, look at this sly jerk.

507
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,279
I saw how your facial expression just changed.

508
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,789
Look at this crazy cyber-path.

509
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,889
You mean "psychopath."

510
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,959
You pretended as if you didn't see me...

511
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,159
in front of Song Yi Heon's house earlier when our eyes met...

512
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,259
on purpose, right?

513
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,768
Yes. How could you be so shameless?

514
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,268
How dare you come here?

515
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,669
Because Song Yi Heon keeps bothering me...

516
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,939
when I don't show up to school.

517
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,508
I came to his house just in case he pestered me again.

518
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,808
What? Am I not allowed to come here?

519
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:27,809
Earlier, you said...

520
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,449
"What are you doing here?"

521
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,848
You seemed very flustered to find out that it was his house.

522
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,890
That's not true.

523
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,759
When I said that,

524
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,660
I meant to ask why you were at Song Yi Heon's house.

525
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,788
That's what I was asking.

526
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,960
Don't be ridiculous.

527
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,499
- You scumbag. - What did you just say?

528
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,569
What did I say?

529
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,400
You said, "You scumbag. Don't be ridiculous."

530
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,480
Watch...

531
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,950
your mouth.

532
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,250
What?

533
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,690
Thanks for the drink.

534
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,690
Sit down.

535
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,460
If you came all the way here for not showing up to school,

536
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,900
it's okay. I'll let you off this time.

537
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,769
Starting tomorrow, don't miss school.

538
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,440
What is it? Do you have something to say?

539
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,309
Can't you tell this jerk to go?

540
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,280
No, I can't.

541
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,889
When I went to your house,

542
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,260
I heard people saying that...

543
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,599
the police were at your house.

544
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,699
Yes.

545
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,069
Some guys came by a few days ago.

546
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,369
And? Are the police tracking the culprit?

547
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,369
No.

548
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,170
I canceled the report.

549
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:09,050
- Why? - I have my reasons.

550
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,479
But how long were you hanging around outside my house...

551
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,750
to even hear about that?

552
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:18,249
Well,

553
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,590
I'm sure you canceled it because it wasn't anything serious.

554
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:24,230
No one got hurt or kidnapped, right?

555
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,900
I was worried.

556
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,280
This is good.

557
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,309
- What is it called? - Caramel macchiato.

558
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,349
"Caramel macchiato?"

559
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,320
I guess it's Japanese.

560
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,159
Haven't you eaten?

561
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,789
I had some leftover rice yesterday morning.

562
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,860
This is so good.

563
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:05,969
And then you starved for two days?

564
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:10,940
Come on out.

565
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,309
Let's eat first.

566
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,050
Thank you for doing this so late.

567
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,090
The kid will clear the dishes. Go on and rest.

568
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,059
This friend seems different from Se Kyung.

569
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,699
You should come over often as well.

570
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,070
Okay.

571
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,639
You understand that she's just being polite, right?

572
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,610
Eat up. She prepared it for you to eat.

573
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,170
Aren't you going? Isn't it late?

574
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,139
- Oh, I was just about to... - This house has many rooms, right?

575
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,039
Hey, what about them?

576
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,079
Can't I sleep over?

577
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,340
Don't you have a house?

578
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,949
I do, but it's a bit cold. They cut off the gas.

579
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,119
How much are the bills?

580
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,019
You've never had gas cut off, have you?

581
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,859
You can't pay it off now even if you wanted to,

582
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
and even if you do, the engineer comes the next morning.

583
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,989
I have to sleep overnight in the cold.

584
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,460
Then go to a sauna.

585
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,599
Let's give him money and make him leave.

586
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,268
- And your parents? - My dad...

587
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:44,599
is in the province for work.

588
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,340
And my mom left home.

589
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,570
Oh, and I have a younger sister,

590
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,638
but she lives at the hair salon to learn hairdressing...

591
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,409
and goes to school from there, so she doesn't come home often.

592
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,119
I'll get a mattress out, so sleep on the floor.

593
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,780
I want to sleep over as well.

594
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:05,050
Won't your father get worried?

595
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Well...

596
00:38:06,321 --> 00:38:08,389
my mother arrived from England today.

597
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,029
She's leaving again tomorrow,

598
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,828
so she's staying at a hotel near the airport.

599
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,559
I'll tell my father that I'm sleeping over there.

600
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,070
My mother lets me sleep over at my friend's house.

601
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
What?

602
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,309
It's a bit small...

603
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:28,480
for all three of us...

604
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,098
Don't bother me and go back to sleep.

605
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,599
The blankets are so soft that I can't sleep.

606
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,840
Can I stay over for a few more days?

607
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:06,380
- What are you doing? - What do you mean?

608
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,749
I'm asking if I can stay over for a few more days...

609
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,750
at my friend's house.

610
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,389
Are we friends?

611
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,460
You stingy thing.

612
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,190
You also beat me like a dog.

613
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,260
Doesn't that make it even?

614
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,499
I didn't even take any videos of you,

615
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,428
lock you up in the gym,

616
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,629
or use you as a dartboard yet.

617
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,899
How is that even?

618
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,968
Come on...

619
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:28,939
That video was taken by our camera guy, Duk Jun.

620
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,968
It wasn't me.

621
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm sure you made him take it.

622
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,538
I clearly asked you to delete it,

623
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,179
and I saw that it was still going around.

624
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,750
He's still awake.

625
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,550
- Are you okay? - Gosh.

626
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,320
Hey.

627
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,049
- Hey, are you sleeping? - Put it on Instagram.

628
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,259
(I guess he couldn't get any sleep from stalking all night.)

629
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,589
(The 2nd part of the report series came out.)

630
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,929
- Look over here. - Hey.

631
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,730
(I report Song Yi Heon, who drinks milk with his hair.)

632
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,069
(His hair must be smoother now!)

633
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,468
(Poor milk. You're going to make him cry.)

634
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,598
(I report the dirty and smelly Song Yi Heon.)

635
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,269
Is that the kid who got hit with milk?

636
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,999
Gosh, isn't he even embarrassed?

637
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,639
Hey, he's not even ashamed.

638
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:04,909
Don't look at him.

639
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,340
Oh, the report series?

640
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,579
That happened in the second year.

641
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,279
We didn't even film them.

642
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,679
It was the other kids that uploaded them.

643
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,050
Isn't it hilarious?

644
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,550
Do you want to see what's hilarious?

645
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,260
Gosh, don't hold a grudge.

646
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:22,829
This isn't holding a grudge.

647
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,260
It's me unable to forgive.

648
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,198
And you're not reflecting enough to be forgiven.

649
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,969
I said I didn't take them.

650
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,169
And what did I do so wrong?

651
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,570
You ate away at someone's soul...

652
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,039
and made his life inhuman,

653
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,539
leading him to think of death.

654
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,150
So did you die?

655
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,349
Did you?

656
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,849
You're fine and alive.

657
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,920
One person will die soon.

658
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,719
- You're a murderer. - "A murderer?"

659
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:55,690
Why, you...

660
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,760
Fine, I'll go home.

661
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,670
I only asked to stay a few days, and you're going all crazy.

662
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,019
You have such thick skin, Jae Min.

663
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,599
What's wrong with you both?

664
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,609
Hey, are you kind of slow,

665
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,570
or is this some kind of new school violence?

666
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:48,239
How can you be shameless enough to stay over at Song Yi Heon's?

667
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,409
You're right.

668
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,280
I heard everything from downstairs.

669
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,750
So what?

670
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:00,059
Have you gone mad since your father is a prosecutor?

671
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,559
Was it fun watching me take one?

672
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:06,460
Yes.

673
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,130
It was so much fun.

674
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,269
Go on and hit me.

675
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,670
What is it? Can't you hit me?

676
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,939
Did you keep harassing Yi Heon...

677
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,280
because it would just get canceled...

678
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,979
even if you got reported for school violence,

679
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,380
and no parents would come for you?

680
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,920
Are you scared to hit me because my father is a prosecutor?

681
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,279
- Bastard. - What?

682
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,049
You don't even understand, you dumbass.

683
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,249
You just swore at me, didn't you?

684
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,419
Why, you little...

685
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,559
You came to Yi Heon's house to check, didn't you?

686
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,590
What? Check what?

687
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,030
Say it clearly.

688
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,828
You only lurked around to check if...

689
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,300
the police were after you.

690
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,369
And you got excited when he said that he canceled the report.

691
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:49,309
How can you ask to stay longer after all that?

692
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,809
What are you talking about, Choi Se Kyung?

693
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,110
What do the police have to do with me?

694
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,780
You're the one who kidnapped Yi Heon's mother.

695
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,250
Are you okay, ma'am?

696
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Are you okay, ma'am?

697
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,829
I saw you in the van.

698
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,329
That's not it.

699
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,899
I went there without knowing about the kidnap.

700
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,530
I even reported it to the police.

701
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:22,170
And she didn't get kidnapped. Isn't that it, then?

702
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,679
Are you playing cat and mouse, Jae Min?

703
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,650
I guess you don't think the process matters...

704
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,679
if the outcome turns out okay?

705
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,519
Hey, down there.

706
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,659
Down there.

707
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,230
Those guys...

708
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,929
Where can I meet them?

709
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:56,809
And you still think of going to school?

710
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,239
You went crazy like you were going to go find them right away.

711
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,039
Haste makes waste.

712
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,980
If you hurry, nothing will turn out right.

713
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,348
And it's a student's duty to attend classes.

714
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,219
Gosh, but why did you have to pull on my hair?

715
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:10,789
You almost pulled them all out.

716
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,118
You were trying to kill me back there, weren't you?

717
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,319
You cyberpass.

718
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,988
It's "psychopath". You idiot.

719
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,769
And you wouldn't've died since we were on the second floor.

720
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,039
I should burn this trash in the ground so it doesn't smell.

721
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,238
Did you just call me "trash?"

722
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,038
No. So should I burn you?

723
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,808
Talk in Korean, you jerk.

724
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,408
Get out and fight with me, you jerk.

725
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,280
Pull over and let us out. This jerk...

726
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,800
(A Full Collection of the Previous CSATs)

727
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:01,099
("Understanding Doppelgangers")

728
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,139
What? He didn't turn it in?

729
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,549
(Everyone has a doppelganger who is like their other self.)

730
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,050
Song Yi Heon also had a doppelganger?

731
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,980
The two met,

732
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,149
and for some reason, the doppelganger pretended...

733
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,889
to be Song Yi Heon.

734
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,400
There's no way a doppelganger exists.

735
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,198
So, Song Yi Heon and his mother...

736
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,630
are a 99.99 percent match.

737
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,039
The two really are related.

738
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,070
If the current Song Yi Heon has the same body...

739
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,610
as the past Song Yi Heon like the test results say...

740
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,050
Then what?

741
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,650
Can it be a split personality?

742
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,230
What are you doing here?

743
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,639
The Kwangsoo Gang is all over here.

744
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,579
The worst they can do is kill us, anyway.

745
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,210
The girl, the kid, and even Lee Mi Kyung...

746
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,480
You must be anxious since you made it so clear.

747
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,550
I do as I say.

748
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,860
If you turn back, you only go back to the beginning...

749
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,460
and all the hard work goes to waste.

750
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,400
Let's only focus on bringing back the Chilsung Gang.

751
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,469
Do you have a good idea?

752
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,110
Let's not overthink it.

753
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,110
Those kids are high school students who head home after school.

754
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,679
- Call the boys. - Yes, sir.

755
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,078
They come occasionally when we sit around...

756
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,489
in front of Sinho Nightclub at Sinho Hotel downtown.

757
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,889
They are gangsters!

758
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,888
I know nothing...

759
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:38,389
other than they are part of the Dongsoo Gang.

760
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,239
"Dongsoo Gang?"

761
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,769
Is that a new gang?

762
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,949
If I want to catch Lee Mi Kyung, I need to meet those guys first.

763
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,650
Hey, let's take a rest from the study room today.

764
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,219
- Where are you going? - There's someone I have to meet.

765
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,719
Mr. Kim,

766
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,259
please go home and keep Mother and Ma'am safe.

767
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,500
And please tighten security.

768
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,099
I'll call if I need you.

769
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,650
Why aren't there any taxis?

770
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,070
It's humid with the mild smell of mold.

771
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,340
An echoing sound.

772
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,639
It's a quite wide area.

773
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,250
Five...

774
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,280
No, six people.

775
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,090
They are quite large men.

776
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,329
Footsteps of an adult.

777
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,630
Tall, sleek, and heavy.

778
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,900
The left leg was hurt once.

779
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,380
It's Dong Soo.

780
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,760
Why, you...

781
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,440
Dong Soo.

782
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,099
What is all this?

783
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:31,369
"Song Yi Heon?"

784
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,940
No wonder your name sounded familiar.

785
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,739
It's that kid who caused Boss Deuk Pal to die.

786
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,110
Here I come.

787
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,578
Go and help him.

788
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,209
His mother can't get kidnapped again.

789
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,348
I couldn't even report it because Yi Heon said not to.

790
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:47,019
Are you crazy? Those people are way older than us.

791
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,250
They're adults who can give us a severe beat down.

792
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,820
Why are you here?

793
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,689
Are you out of your mind?

794
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,129
And you call yourself a gangster?

795
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,900
Don't you even have any pride as the Chilsung Gang?

796
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,529
Break up the Dongsoo Gang...

797
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,769
and bring Lee Mi Kyung to me.
