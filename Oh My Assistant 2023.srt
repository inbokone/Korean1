Of course, I didn't always draw X-rated comics.

As I struggled to make a unique work
in the competitive webtoon field,

I ended up on this path without realizing it.

Hey, if you draw X-rated comics,

don't you have dirty thoughts whenever you work?

Working overtime for deadlines isn't optional,
but it's mandatory.

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,460
That is if I get to see you again.

162
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,080
Let's meet again. Let's meet tomorrow.

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,780
Pardon?

164
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
You're hired! Please be my assistant.

165
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,080
I thought I'd make it,

166
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,680
but I didn't think you'd tell me right away.

167
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,580
Please start coming in tomorrow, then.

168
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,200
Yes, I will.

169
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,440
Yes!

170
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,550
Anyway, what was that?

171
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,800
It wasn't broken?

172
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,610
Why all of a sudden...

173
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,050
Geez. Wow.

174
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,620
What's with that shirt?

175
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,590
You didn't go to the interview like that, right?

176
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,840
It's a long story.

177
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,570
- I'll have what he's having.
- Yes.

178
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,830
You seem to be in a good mood.

179
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,240
What was he like in person?

180
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,890
You've liked that artist for a long time.

181
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,910
Is he your type?

182
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,250
What?

183
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,640
I guess he is.

184
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,150
Should I keep guessing, then?

185
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,090
He has curly and shaggy hair.

186
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,960
He has a silly smile.

187
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,710
He's an innocent puppy type.

188
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,260
This... won't suit you, would it?

189
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,080
I was right.

190
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,290
Whoa!

191
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,160
Go Mu Yeong, your type has always been so consistent.

192
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,390
- Your first love was-
- That's enough, Han Joon Seok.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,420
Anyway, good luck. You never know.

194
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,410
There's no chance. He's straight.

195
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,800
He draws X-rated comics.

196
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,350
There's no way a straight man would like me.

197
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,460
Excuse me. Looks like you're here together.

198
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,020
I'd like to get you drinks if you don't mind.

199
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,970
The one with the glasses is so handsome.

200
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,530
I'm okay.

201
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,780
My gosh.

202
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,130
Okay!

203
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,510
Hey.

204
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,160
He winked when he said, "Okay."

205
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,170
So why do you keep suggesting drinking here?

206
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,610
Because it's easy to meet someone here.

207
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,740
And I get to chat with you, too.

208
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,190
I get to kill two birds with one stone.

209
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,700
Only you get to kill two birds.

210
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,130
Where are you going?

211
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,090
To the restroom.

212
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,040
Excuse me.

213
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,480
He's straight, Mu Yeong.

214
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,640
Get it together.

215
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,990
My goodness. Is all of that your stuff?

216
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,600
I brought my own computer.

217
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm used to using it.

218
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,170
I can use mine, right?

219
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,730
Of course.

220
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,170
- I'm having coffee, would you like-
- That's okay.

221
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,490
- I won't spill it this time-
- I already had some.

222
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,540
Here.

223
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,360
What's this?

224
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,100
I already washed it. You can wear it right away.

225
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,050
My gosh. You didn't have to wash it.

226
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,330
That won't be polite.

227
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,590
Should we...

228
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,390
start working then?

229
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,840
What's wrong?

230
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,090
Is there a problem?

231
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,900
No.

232
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,350
Why do you keep sighing?

233
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,300
By chance... do you not like the layout I just put together?

234
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,840
What? No. It's not that.

235
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm struggling to draw a pose.

236
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,560
I've been drawing the same sequence for an hour.

237
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,680
That was it?

238
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,740
Let me know whenever something like that comes up.

239
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,960
I'll help you.

240
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,490
I just need to pose for you, right?

241
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,040
Really? Thank you...

242
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,520
Would you be okay?

243
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,200
Spread the legs a bit and...

244
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,620
That'd be too much, huh?

245
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,890
No. It's just for work.

246
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,830
Do you want to take a photo?

247
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,670
Well, I think I can just do a quick drawing.

248
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,700
There's no good place to put my hands.

249
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,830
If so, do you want to pose on my bed?

250
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,190
I think we can come up with the exact pose I want there.

251
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,470
Try not to have weird thoughts.

252
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,410
He's working seriously.

253
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,340
That's right...

254
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,210
I'll erect the center and...

255
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,160
- Erect?
- I'll make this area a bit firm.

256
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,120
Firm?

257
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,680
rHold for a second.

258
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,830
Let me draw just one more.

259
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,950
Mr. Shin, why is it so hard to reach you?

260
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,610
Oh, my.

261
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,780
My gosh, Mr. Shin...

262
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,130
What are you doing right now...

263
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,130
No. It's not that, PD.

264
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,350
He's my assistant-

265
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,510
I think I interrupted a nice moment.

266
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,480
I'm sorry. I thought you had fallen asleep.

267
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,370
Well, you did look like you had fallen.

268
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,360
Well, anyway... Carry on, then!

269
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,450
No, PD, he's my assistant.

270
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,910
You can do that with an assistant, too!

271
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,680
I understand everything. I don't have any prejudice.

272
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,820
It's not that. We were coming up with a pose-

273
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,140
A pose? What kind of pose did you want?

274
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,280
Gosh, Mr. Shin!

275
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,130
If you have a good pose like that,

276
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,920
don't use it on yourself, and use it in your work, too!

277
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,060
It's not that. We were practicing
so I could use the pose in my work.

278
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,840
Practice?

279
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,870
Using your bodies?

280
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,640
You're definitely a hard-working artist.

281
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,290
It's not that!

282
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,410
He was struggling to draw a pose he wanted.

283
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,160
We just fell down while I was helping him.

284
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,290
Okay.

285
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,250
Well, PD. I didn't give you the passcode,

286
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,680
so you can barge in anytime like this.

287
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,750
I wouldn't have come if I wasn't so desperate.

288
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,120
I just dropped in since I had a meeting nearby.

289
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,910
Because I was worried you'd miss the deadline!

290
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,880
I wouldn't do that.

291
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,940
This is my new assistant, Ko Mu Yeong.

292
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,280
Oh, is he that handsome one we saw?

293
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
He's the one who has great drawing skills.

294
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,480
Luckily, we got to work together.

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,660
Hello! I'm Producer Lee Min Yeong, who works with Mr. Shin.

296
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,150
Yes, hello.

297
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,470
Since we have a new assistant, should we go out for a meal together?

298
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,280
Is there anything you want to eat? I'll treat you with a company card!

299
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,390
I know that the deadlines are important,
but how could he give her his home passcode?

300
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,690
I have so many things I want to eat.

301
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,950
- Is he always like this?
- Tonkatsu, sashimi...

302
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,350
Or are these two...

303
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,410
You'll join us, too, right?

304
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,730
No.

305
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,540
I'll just be in the way while you two work.

306
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
No, we're not working.

307
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,370
We'll just be eating.

308
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,910
That's what I'm saying, Mr. Shin.

309
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,320
Why would business people
eat and spend personal time together?

310
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,390
Yes. Don't refuse, and join us.

311
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,360
- Let's go!
- Okay.

312
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,940
Whoa, that looks so good.

313
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,290
I'm so hungry.

314
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,290
You're hungry, right?

315
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,980
They make really good sashimi, too.

316
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,480
Let's come back for a team dinner after we finish this draft.

317
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
- Okay?
- Yes.

318
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,340
Right. You must be hungry, too, aren't you?

319
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,550
Yes, I guess.

320
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,190
Have some!

321
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,190
Right! By the way...

322
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,690
can we talk about work for a second?

323
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,710
Come on, you said we wouldn't talk about work.

324
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,740
Should I not, then?

325
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,560
Instead, keep it brief, okay?

326
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,100
Okay.

327
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,920
In the updated draft you just sent me...

328
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,940
This scene.

329
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,960
Yes.

330
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,060
The scene where he rips the shirt off.

331
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,730
It's so sexy! It's so hot!

332
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,550
The sequences improved a lot!

333
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,060
Is that so?

334
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,400
It really feels like he's ripping it.

335
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,670
Have you done it before?

336
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,110
Pardon? No.

337
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,940
Well...

338
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,430
It's not that...

339
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,840
The thing is...

340
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, I...

341
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,510
The translucent flesh you see underneath here

342
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,790
really brings out the sexual feeling, you know?

343
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,840
That was really good.

344
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,560
Mr. Shin, I'll count on you then.

345
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,830
Take care, then.

346
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,380
See you again soon!

347
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,420
Wasn't the sushi good?

348
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,030
Did you feel uncomfortable at all?

349
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,160
Well, I guess not.

350
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,690
I think I need to take a quick nap.

351
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,220
I haven't woken up so early in a while.

352
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,740
Right, you should take a nap, too, if you're tired.

353
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,730
That's okay.

354
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,280
I should work.

355
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,410
Yes, I'll work hard for the deadline, too.

356
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,140
Fighting!

357
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,160
What are you doing...

358
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,890
Mr. Shin.

359
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,800
Mr. Shin, it's already 6...

360
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,090
What are you doing...

361
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,850
He looks cute when he sleeps, too.

362
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,620
Mu Yeong...

363
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,480
Mu Yeong...

364
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,780
Mu Yeong?

365
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,360
Mu Yeong... Mu Yeong?

366
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,540
Is he talking about me by chance?

367
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,810
Hold on.

368
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,270
By Mu Yeong, did he mean...Mi Yeong...

369
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,940
Min Yeong...

370
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,990
Min Yeong?

371
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,000
It could be Min Yeong!

372
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,730
Is it Mu Yeong or Min Yeong?

373
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,190
Hold on.

374
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,740
It can't be me.

375
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,840
There's no way.

376
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,690
Wake up, Ko Mu Yeong!

377
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,780
I should just wake him up...

378
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,060
But I hope it's me.

379
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,670
I hope he calls my name.

380
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,650
Mu Yeong!

381
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,350
Get up, Mr. Shin!

382
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm sorry!

383
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
Get up quickly. It's time for me to go home.

384
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,790
Already?

385
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,200
You should've woken me up earlier.

386
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,530
I did, but you didn't wake up.

387
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,880
Anyway, I'm going home now.

388
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,610
Okay, bye.

389
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,240
Okay, bye... I'll sleep more.

390
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,200
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

391
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,510
I'm on my way home.

392
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,190
Really?

393
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,370
What are you doing?

394
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,340
I'm nearby. Should we have dinner together?

395
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,970
Okay, come to my place.

396
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,070
Okay.

397
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,600
I'll be right there.

398
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,380
Okay.

399
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,900
You're leaving? Right now?

400
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,460
Are you out of your mind?

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,220
You planned to go see a musical with me!

402
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,640
What can I do?

403
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,220
It looks like he's troubled.

404
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,550
Do you care more about your friend than your girlfriend?

405
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,060
You know.

406
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,740
I'm Mu Yeong's only friend.

407
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,770
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,040
Hey. You have something on your mind, don't you?

409
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,240
I do? What are you talking about?

410
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,510
Not at all.

411
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,910
I don't think so.

412
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,160
I think you do.

413
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,610
I know just by looking at your face.

414
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,090
Don't waste your time and just tell me.

415
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,650
You'll end up telling me everything anyway.

416
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,150
Why are you so hesitant to say it?

417
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,270
Is it serious?

418
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,380
Are you terminally ill or something?

419
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,450
"Mu Yeong..."

420
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,930
What?

421
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,320
"Mu Yeong..."

422
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,690
What does that sound like to you?

423
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,800
"Muy..."

424
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,860
Do you understand that?

425
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,930
It's a person's name. But it trailed off at the end.

426
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,900
Does it sound like Mu Yeong or Min Yeong?

427
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,480
Did that artist say that?

428
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,610
Why are you laughing?

429
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,420
I'm asking if that artist guy said that.

430
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,450
Yeah.

431
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,300
Who's Min Yeong, then?

432
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,560
It's his producer.

433
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,400
He should've pronounced it correctly
if he was going to say it.

434
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,210
Why did he have to trail off at the end like that?

435
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,620
He was sleep-talking.

436
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,530
Sleep-talking?

437
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,990
Sleep-talking?

438
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,220
Did you sleep with him already?

439
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,990
Geez, we don't have that kind of relationship!

440
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,400
If so...

441
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,950
you don't have to worry
if it was Min Yeong or Mu Yeong.

442
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,970
That's...

443
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,900
You definitely are into him.

444
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,430
But nothing changes.

445
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,750
He's straight.

446
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,780
You don't know if he's straight or bisexual.

447
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,140
Who knows? He might be bisexual without even realizing it.

448
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,410
Also...

449
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,090
you never know about people's feelings.

450
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,860
Once you fall for someone,

451
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,400
your true feelings come out without realizing it.

452
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,610
You totally slept with him.

453
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,610
Mu Yeong...

454
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,810
It's cold.

455
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,690
It is.

456
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,160
You really don't want to go get a drink?

457
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,330
No.

458
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,430
I don't even feel like it.

459
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,860
I have a bit of a headache, too.

460
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,130
You have a headache?

461
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,430
Do you have a fever? Let me see.

462
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,900
It's not like that.

463
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,740
I'm okay.

464
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,960
You should get going.

465
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,350
You must be tired.

466
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,810
Okay.

467
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,820
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

468
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,250
[Artist Shin Seon Ho: You should've woken me up before you left.

469
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm dying right now because
I have so many sequences left to draw.

470
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,470
It must be hard for him to do it alone.

471
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,480
Maybe I should've stayed and helped him.

472
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,060
I left without finishing because I was caught off guard.

473
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,490
[Mr. Shin]

474
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,360
You know what?

475
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,510
When you finish late,

476
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,960
the producers have to go home late, too.

477
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,870
But some producers probably have kids, right?

478
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,380
Then the teachers at the daycare
would go home late, too, right?

479
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,070
At that rate, everyone in the world would be working late.

480
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,960
That's great.

481
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,980
Isn't it?

482
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,620
Yes...

483
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,630
I treated you to a meal so you'd be energized.

484
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,570
How can you fall asleep?

485
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,800
And you blamed me for barging in.

486
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,610
What would you do if you missed the deadline at this rate?

487
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,250
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

488
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,860
I totally had an amazing nap without knowing.

489
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,900
It would've been nice
if you had the assistant around at times like this.

490
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,200
Did he go home already?

491
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,440
He's only supposed to work until 6 p.m.,
according to the contract.

492
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,790
Don't worry and go home.

493
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,180
I'll make sure to send you the material before midnight.

494
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,050
You mean that, right?

495
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,030
You won't make me come here again, right?

496
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,980
Of course not.

497
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,380
I'll trust you and leave then.

498
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,350
- I'm going home!
- Trust me. Yes.

499
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,890
Mr. Shin, thanks in advance.

500
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,920
Fighting!
- Fighting.

501
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,020
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

502
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,250
I slept so much, yet I'm sleepy again.

503
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,900
I should take a shower first.

504
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,220
Mu Yeong, thank you!

505
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,690
You're the best!

506
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,210
Okay.

507
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll help him just today.

508
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,310
Just for two hours.

509
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,770
M-Mu Yeong.

510
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,640
How nice.

511
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,690
Mr. Shin has a nice body.

512
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,530
- Mu Yeong.
- Well...

513
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,030
I thought it'd be too much for you
to finish the work alone.

514
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,620
So I wanted to help you...

515
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,770
Of course, I'll come in late tomorrow
since I'd be working late tonight.

516
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,440
It'd be just for two hours.

517
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,820
Thank you, Mu Yeong.

518
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,590
Please come inside.

519
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,550
Wow! I sent it!

520
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,660
I dodged the bullet for now.

521
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,950
Well done, Mu Yeong.

522
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,700
Should we take a break
since we took care of the urgent stuff?

523
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,360
By the way, Mr. Shin.

524
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,830
Don't you feel a bit chilly?

525
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,620
Is it because it's early morning?

526
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,690
Should I turn up the boiler temperature?

527
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,890
The boiler is...broken.

528
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,960
I forgot to fix it.

529
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,470
Should we turn the heater on, then?

530
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,940
I think I...

531
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,190
I do have a heater, but...

532
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,610
I had one, but it's gone now.

533
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,710
Would you like to borrow my clothes by chance?

534
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,690
It's okay.

535
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,110
Would you like a blanket, then...

536
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,780
It's okay.

537
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,190
Would you like a drink, then?

538
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,530
I think it'd warm you up a bit.

539
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,410
Okay then.

540
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,890
Wow, Mu Yeong.

541
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,100
You know how to make this kind of stuff, too?

542
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,630
Cheers.

543
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,080
I definitely think it's warming me up.

544
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,790
You drink vodka, too?

545
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,800
Min Yeong gave it to me as a present.

546
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,400
I've been saving it because I didn't know how to drink it.

547
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,030
I'll take some more.

548
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,630
You won't be able to work if you drink too much.

549
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,770
Should we call it a night, then?

550
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,500
We finished the most urgent stuff.

551
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,740
We haven't had a chance
to have a team dinner since you joined.

552
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,230
- We should drink like this, at least.

553
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,610
Well...since we worked hard tonight,

554
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,860
you should do as you wish.

555
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,280
By the way, why do you work as an assistant?

556
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,350
Considering your talent, you could debut right away.

557
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,300
I wanted to become a comic artist when I was a student.

558
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,710
But imagining how a character moves,

559
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,450
and how the next scene unfolds

560
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,990
was pretty difficult.

561
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,390
I started drawing...

562
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,030
because I was copying someone I liked.

563
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,470
Don't you have a girlfriend, Mu Yeong?

564
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,040
No.

565
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,740
- How about you?
- I...

566
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,080
have been single for three years.

567
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,670
I see.

568
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,870
I guess he wasn't dating Min Yeong.

569
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,340
Although I'm not certain if it's a fling or not.

570
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,000
Three years ago,

571
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,910
I met my first love.

572
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,790
She demanded a lot of things from me.

573
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,480
"Why do you make comics? Why don't you have a car?"

574
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,050
I had no money, car, house, or vision.

575
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,720
What a foolish person she must've been.

576
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,650
Don't you want to have a girlfriend?

577
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,550
It's too much of a hassle for me.

578
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,520
Having to spend energy to maintain a relationship

579
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,910
is not appealing to me.

580
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,120
But it'd be different if it were with you.

581
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,740
I guess it can be like that.

582
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,000
But don't you get more energy out of it?

583
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,750
I think I just...

584
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,760
like the warmth you get when you're together.

585
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,510
I think that's a nice feeling on its own.

586
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,280
If it were me,

587
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,610
I would've held on and never let you go.

588
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,250
Shall we drink, then?

589
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,270
Hold on.

590
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,910
What am I thinking about?

591
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,220
Know your place, Ko Mu Yeong.

592
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,260
This drink makes me feel warm, too.

593
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,350
Mu Yeong.

594
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,010
I have a favor to ask.

595
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,640
- I'll say no.
- Don't be like that.

596
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,980
- Don't ask me anything.
- Just this once, please?

597
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,690
Please?

598
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,950
What is it anyway?

599
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,330
You can't change the contract condition.

600
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,220
I'd like to...

601
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,680
try drawing you.

602
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,860
To be exact,

603
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,300
I'd like to draw your topless body.

604
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,690
Pardon?

605
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,180
Nude?

606
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,060
Gosh, don't get any funny ideas.

607
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,990
It's because I'm an artist.

608
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,390
What's he saying?

609
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,540
I didn't have a lot of chances to do figure drawings.

610
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,260
Before I started the series,

611
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,670
I used to be in a nude figure drawing club too.

612
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,890
I hate showing my naked body to other people.

613
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,700
Just this once, please?

614
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,770
I don't want to.

615
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,090
You'd be topless, not totally naked.

616
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,180
You saw my body earlier today, too.

617
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,380
You're coming at me without warning like this?

618
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,810
I didn't see that because I wanted to.

619
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,370
Be fair and just show me.

620
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,440
Mr. Shin, are you drunk?

621
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,980
Yes.

622
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,780
I am drunk.

623
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,910
- I don't want to!
- Please.

624
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,090
Please?

625
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,020
How did this happen?

626
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,520
Ko Mu Yeong.

627
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,120
Why couldn't you say no?

628
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,430
I'll just do one pose.

629
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,810
Just for a minute.

630
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,560
So you should draw quickly.

631
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,010
Okay.

632
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,770
How long will you be drawing for?

633
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,740
It's been almost a minute.

634
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,440
I'll draw just a few more.

635
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,260
I'd like to draw from different angles.

636
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,480
Aren't you working too hard?

637
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,330
What's so fun about drawing a man's body?

638
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,870
You probably don't know this,

639
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,000
but your facial expression is interesting.

640
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,770
It looks like you don't care,

641
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,160
but you seem full of affection,

642
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,750
and sexy.

643
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,870
Who started first?

644
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,150
I don't know what happened all of a sudden.

645
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,750
I didn't plan this from the beginning.

646
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,160
I tried to hold back, but...

647
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,010
How much did I drink?

648
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,320
Did I drink too much last night?

649
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,280
What?

650
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,930
What's this?

651
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,350
I didn't kiss. I didn't!

652
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,010
Probably not.

653
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,580
It wasn't a kiss.

654
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,170
It wasn't.

655
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,030
Do I like men, too?

656
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,280
I've never thought about that before.

657
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,820
Hold on.

658
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,280
"You're sexy."

659
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,420
I must be crazy!

660
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,640
Did I really say that?

661
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:50,280
Mr. Shin fell asleep right away
after what happened last night.

662
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,890
But when I saw Min Yeong's makeup pouch,

663
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,100
I suddenly had a wake-up call.

664
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,490
She was definitely there before I came

665
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,780
and Mr. Shin took a shower.

666
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,140
And he kissed me.

667
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,500
But that kiss was...so sweet.

668
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,890
I had no choice but to leave as though I was running away.

669
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,430
I keep feeling crappy.

670
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,950
My phone!

671
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,470
What should I do?

672
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,900
Hold on.

673
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,290
Should I call or not?

674
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,990
How could I face him now?

675
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,540
[Writer Shin Seon Ho]

676
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,500
Hello?

677
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,840
- Mu Yeong.
- Mr. Shin.

678
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,330
I'm thinking of taking a day off
since I don't feel so good.

679
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,150
- Would that be okay?
- Well, yes.

680
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,770
That's okay.

681
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,280
But more importantly,

682
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,930
about last night...

683
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,530
Don't worry about that.

684
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,250
We both got drunk and made a mistake.

685
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,030
Well, yes.

686
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,900
- Well, then...
- Hello?

687
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,500
Mu Yeong. Mu Yeong!

688
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,710
Mr. Shin has Min Yeong.

689
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,300
This is painful.

690
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,190
Why is he so indifferent?

691
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,050
Am I old-fashioned?

692
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,020
I mean, does Mu Yeong think nothing of this?

693
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,290
Geez, I was the only one anxious,

694
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,010
acting like a puppy who needs to poop.

695
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,760
But still, I'm glad he wasn't offended.

696
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,890
Well, what am I talking about right now?

697
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,030
I remember the texture.

698
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,060
Could I continue to work with him
as if nothing happened?

699
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,030
- Mr. Shin!
- Yes?

700
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,090
I want you to look at the rough sketches I did.

701
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,790
Do they look okay to you?

702
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,020
Well, yes!

703
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,420
How's kimchi stew for lunch?

704
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,700
Kimchi stew sounds good.

705
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,410
Are we adding kimchi to ramen?

706
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,050
I'll cook for you today.

707
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,580
Wake up, wake up!

708
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,510
Be careful with this.

709
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,170
Is Mu Yeong really indifferent about what happened?

710
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,780
Am I the only one who's concerned?

711
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,470
I'll get going, then.

712
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,310
Wait, Mu Yeong.

713
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,270
Would you like to have dinner together?

714
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,080
- I'll order fried chicken-
- No. I have a plan.

715
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,270
Well, okay.

716
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,160
See you then!

717
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,630
Are you...

718
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,630
really indifferent, Mu Yeong?

719
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,410
I have no choice but to act indifferent.

720
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,570
Where are you? Can I see you now?

721
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,330
Yeah, okay.

722
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,660
Let's meet at JJ.

723
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,050
I'll head over there now.

724
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,530
This really isn't normal.

725
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,650
I said I'm sorry.

726
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,800
Why can't you tell him that you're with me?

727
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,650
You should've rescheduled instead.

728
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,290
When Mu Yeong calls me first,
it means something's going on.

729
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,790
We see each other every day.

730
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,630
Every day?

731
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,330
Oppa, we haven't met in a week!

732
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,750
How about our plan to get wedding bands today?

733
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,640
All right.

734
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,210
I'll bring you a present next time I see you.

735
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,930
Gosh. You're doing this again.

736
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,470
I'm tired of it.

737
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,340
People might think you two are dating.

738
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,100
Stop joking around.

739
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,690
I'll get going.

740
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,630
You're meeting another man leaving your fiancée behind!

741
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,070
You know how weird that is?

742
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,070
That's enough.

743
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,220
Something happened, huh?

744
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,410
You even called me first.

745
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,370
No.

746
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,780
Not really.

747
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,930
I just wanted to meet with someone.

748
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,720
Is everything okay with that comic artist?

749
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,030
- Hey, Joon Seok.
- Yeah?

750
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,860
You really are straight, right?

751
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,710
What are you talking about?

752
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,690
Have you ever...

753
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,800
been affectionate with a man after drinking?

754
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,630
Are you crazy?

755
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,770
Would that be possible if you were bi?

756
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,710
Bi?

757
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,890
You mean bisexual?

758
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,700
Did you get yourself in trouble
with that comic artist or something?

759
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,950
Seriously?

760
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,950
Well, it wasn't anything serious.

761
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,680
It was just a light touch.

762
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,170
I played along with you
because I thought you weren't serious.

763
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,280
But it's more serious than I thought.

764
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,100
Don't make it complicated.

765
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,500
Getting involved with a straight man was never good.

766
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,320
Joon Seok... knows all about
how I got hurt for having feelings

767
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,200
for people I don't have a chance with.

768
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,300
- You like me?
- Yes.

769
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,470
As more than just a friend.

770
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,720
Then, did you want to kiss me, too?

771
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,800
Hey.

772
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,090
To be honest, it's kind of gross.

773
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,060
Don't tell anyone that you like me.

774
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,270
Don't act like you know me, either.

775
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:40,990
He must be worried
that I might make another foolish mistake.

776
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:48,030
"Would I be able to find someone I love
and who loves me back?"

777
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,380
Hey!

778
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,710
Why bring that up after all these years?

779
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,180
You said that yourself when you were
in high school. Don't you remember?

780
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,860
I don't!

781
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,050
That thing called love.

782
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,850
I searched for it everywhere when I was a kid.

783
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,280
Love isn't a big deal.

784
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,020
Love is a big deal.

785
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,140
Meet someone adequate at an adequate time,

786
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,440
date adequately and get married.

787
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,620
Although I don't believe that anymore.

788
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,770
Right.

789
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,150
It's good to enjoy in moderation.

790
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,500
By chance...

791
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,050
This is my first time watching this.

792
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,220
But it's not as shocking as I thought.

793
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:46,430
Actually, I found something else shocking.

794
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,650
The fact that...

795
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,450
You're sexy.

796
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,220
I thought of Mu Yeong while watching it.

797
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,540
My heart is racing again.

798
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,200
To be honest,

799
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,370
this happens whenever I think of Mu Yeong.

800
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,500
What's this now?

801
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,230
Why am I like this again?

802
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:18,670
♫ I tried denying it ♫

803
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,090
Is it because of what happened recently?

804
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,640
♫ I can't seem to sit still ♫

805
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,060
No. It was like this before, too.

806
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,580
Do I really...

807
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,960
like Mu Yeong?

808
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,620
Thinking about it, I want to make him laugh,

809
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,920
I want to be with him, touch him,

810
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,740
and I want to see him.

811
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,250
I do like him.

812
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,630
I feel strange.

813
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,600
I've never liked a man before.

814
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,300
Thinking about it,

815
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,810
I have never resisted it.

816
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,830
Hey, Seon Ho. Check this out.

817
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,030
Isn't it daebak?

818
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,370
How could men date each other?

819
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,860
- Does that make sense?
- I know. I don't think I can.

820
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,080
Is that so?

821
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,200
It's not a big deal if they like each other,
don't you think?

822
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,410
Hey, I can't like someone
with the same thing dangling as me.

823
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,230
Right, how's that normal?

824
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,450
I don't know. It has nothing to do with me.

825
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,430
I lost because of you earlier.

826
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,610
Hey, Seon Ho. What do you want to eat?

827
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,400
I don't know.

828
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,060
Jjajang? Champong?*
(Blackbean noodles, spicy seafood noodles)

829
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,880
What should I eat?

830
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,420
Just get what you want.

831
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,170
I like both.

832
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,620
Why don't you get a combo, then?

833
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,580
I've always gotten a combo.

834
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,290
I like dogs.

835
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,540
And I like cats, too.

836
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,050
I like latte.

837
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,080
And I like Americano, too.

838
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,370
With ice cream, I like half vanilla

839
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,170
and half chocolate too.

840
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,800
Needless to say,

841
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,250
I got half fried, and half spicy marinate, too.

842
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,440
Do I like men, too, now?

843
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,310
Half men, half women?

844
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,700
If Mu Yeong finds out about this,

845
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,780
what would he think of me?

846
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,680
I like you.

847
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,550
For me, men are...

848
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,720
no good.

849
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,810
- I like you!
- Can't believe you saw me that way.

850
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,220
I'm offended.

851
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,400
I like-

852
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,470
I can't work with you anymore.

853
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,770
I like-

854
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,620
You're an animal!

855
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,790
No matter what I imagine, he always ends up quitting.

856
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,160
But that night, he definitely...

857
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,820
I might... have a chance.

858
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,560
By the way,

859
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,940
how should I seduce him?

860
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,250
With my looks, words, or ability?

861
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,060
All I have is...

862
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,820
this body of mine.

863
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,900
Should I just seduce him with my body?

864
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,700
What am I thinking about right now?

865
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,430
Should I just... seduce him with my body?

866
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,790
Wake up!

867
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,300
You didn't want to seduce him like this!

868
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,290
Hold on.

869
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,580
Why is it doing this again...

870
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

871
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,980
Damn it! Why are you guys both doing this?

872
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,140
Why is one swaying my heart
and the other is swaying my body-

873
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,360
We're here. Let's go.

874
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:58,350
♫ Until the East Sea dries and Mt. Baekdu wears off ♫

875
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,550
I think we picked the wrong time to do photo research.

876
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,230
It's so crowded because it's Friday.

877
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,130
I know.

878
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,350
We should do this when it's not crowded next time.

879
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,240
Sure, let's do that.

880
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,500
Should we try going that way?

881
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,260
♫ I can't help looking at you ♫

882
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,040
♫ I try to ignore it ♫

883
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,570
♫ But the distance between us keeps getting close ♫

884
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:46,260
♫ I can't seem to stay put ♫

885
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,940
♫ I'm curious what your day is like ♫

886
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,610
♫ I try imagining it ♫

887
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:58,950
♫ You make a fool out of me all day ♫

888
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:03,890
♫ I'm broken because of you ♫

889
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,140
Well, Mu Yeong.

890
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,590
May I ask you something?

891
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:14,900
Pardon?

892
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,010
What do you think about it?

893
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,910
About what?

894
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,930
Well... A man dating a man.

895
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,710
Pardon?

896
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,980
I'm not sure.

897
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,150
I don't think much about it.

898
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,430
If so, d-do you think it's possible?

899
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,870
Yes, I guess.

900
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,590
A lot of people are actually like that.

901
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,960
So you're fine with it, right?

902
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,080
It's not like you hate it or anything?

903
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,440
No. There's no reason to hate it.

904
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,540
Because it doesn't concern me.

905
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,590
Yes.

906
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,210
By the way, Mr. Shin...

907
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:01,030
Why do you keep asking me stuff like that?

908
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:04,170
Is there a man you like by chance?

909
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,370
What? Aigoo!

910
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,500
There's no way. No.

911
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,060
Come on, it's not like that!

912
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,070
I... I just... suddenly...

913
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,730
I was just thinking about my next project

914
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,280
and the idea came up. That's why I asked.

915
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,460
Yes.

916
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,780
It's okay to tell me.

917
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,550
I don't have a bias like that.

918
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,560
Okay...

919
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,350
Hold on. What am I thinking?

920
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,700
I scored a lot of photo materials thanks to you.

921
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,630
It's nothing. It's my job to help you.

922
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,200
You must be tired from doing fieldwork.

923
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,700
- Why don't we call it a day?

924
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,050
Okay.Aren't you going home?

925
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,110
I'm meeting someone.

926
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,720
I'll stay here a bit longer.

927
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,650
Meeting someone?

928
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,060
Okay, I'll get going, then.

929
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,420
Is she the one he's meeting with?

930
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,940
Ms. Lee. You look so tired.

931
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,750
Yes. If you had sent me the draft quickly,

932
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,420
I wouldn't be tired.

933
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,190
Should I move in if you have an empty room in your studio?

934
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,620
I'm sorry.

935
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,280
I'm just kidding.

936
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,920
What are they meeting for?

937
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,020
I suggested meeting today
because I wanted to discuss work stuff.

938
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,370
- Yes.
- Mr. Shin.

939
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,720
Your draft has improved so much lately!

940
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,470
You even got me excited!

941
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,610
Yes.

942
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,240
[Anxiety]
His face suddenly turned red.

943
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,160
What could they be talking about?

944
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,140
Holding hands?

945
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,890
Did they just hold hands?

946
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,300
Were they having a fling after all?

947
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,410
Also, in the last chapter, where they tie each other up,

948
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,650
it was refreshing. But...

949
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,450
that's not how you handcuff someone.

950
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,770
I thought you could just put it on.

951
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,330
You've never been handcuffed, have you?

952
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,970
Most people haven't.

953
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,800
That's why I brought it here to teach you.

954
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,380
Why do you have so many?

955
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,250
You never know when they'd come in handy.

956
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,310
Okay, focus.

957
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,590
You put it on like that.

958
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,100
They're using that at a place like this?

959
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,980
Rather than showing it from this angle,

960
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,140
this angle would be better.

961
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,180
I see. Yes.

962
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,220
You're good at strapping quickly.

963
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,880
Of course, I've been working on X-rated comics
for several years now.

964
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,290
This is considered basic!

965
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,310
Should I show you something else, too?

966
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,170
Hold on!

967
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,380
There are...

968
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,890
underaged people who can see us.

969
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,260
[Anxiety]

970
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,220
Well, anyway!

971
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,890
You can fix the handcuff scene like this.

972
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,420
But the art direction became so much more daring.

973
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,440
I was so surprised!

974
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,310
Has something happened to you lately?

975
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,150
Are you seeing someone by chance?

976
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,100
Doing stuff like this?

977
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,010
My gosh!

978
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,690
My gosh, my gosh, my gosh!

979
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:56,240
They even do stuff like that?

980
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,760
It's not like that!

981
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,170
Anyway, could you undo this-

982
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:01,400
You can tell me!

983
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,970
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

984
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,580
- But could you undo this-
- Forget it if you're not.

985
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,620
Also, a lot of other artists
use SketchUp for backgrounds.

986
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,500
Don't you use SketchUp?

987
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,080
No. I prefer to draw them by hand.

988
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,440
My assistant is doing a good job with the backgrounds.

989
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,020
I see.

990
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,140
I heard SketchUp helps you save time.

991
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,060
- That's why I asked.
- I see.

992
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,180
It's hard to get the right photo for reference

993
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,080
but I can draw quickly as long as the photo is good.

994
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,660
I wish I could get you all the photos.

995
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,430
If there's an office scene,
feel free to take them in our office!

996
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,940
Really?

997
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,590
The office backgrounds would be great!

998
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:42,470
Just let me know what locations
you think I could get for you.

999
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:46,650
I'll ask family, friends, acquaintances,
and everyone to help you!

1000
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,270
The places I have access to are

1001
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:53,190
a bar, pharmacy, restaurant, hotel,
furniture studio, and a barbeque restaurant.

1002
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,970
I think that's about it.

1003
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,800
Whoa, actually, in the next chapter,
there will be a hotel and a bar scene.

1004
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,790
That's great!

1005
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,350
My cousin works at a hotel front desk.

1006
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,840
And the bar is owned by an acquaintance.
I'm sure you could take pictures.

1007
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,170
They're both around here!

1008
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,210
- Should we go now?
- Really?

1009
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,480
Well, but you should undo this...

1010
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,830
Wait...

1011
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,880
What?

1012
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,840
Where is he going like that?

1013
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,270
[Hotel Elle Inn]

1014
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,400
This is it.

1015
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,790
Ms. Lee.

1016
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,800
Am I going in like this by chance?

1017
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,090
I'm sorry!

1018
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,220
They're holding hands in front of a hotel?

1019
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,750
I requested a bathroom with a semitransparent glass door.

1020
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:45,880
Semitransparent?

1021
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,300
Might as well choose a place
where we can get a fantastic scene.

1022
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,230
That's true.

1023
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,760
Of course. Let's go.

1024
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,170
- Let's go!
- Yes.

1025
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,670
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

1026
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,080
What am I doing? So foolish.

1027
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,670
I didn't even have a reason for a heartache.

1028
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,000
Hey!

1029
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,310
I heard you like men.

1030
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,920
Do you date all the men you like?

1031
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,510
Does this make you excited? It does, doesn't it?

1032
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,820
Are you nervous?

1033
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,470
You are, huh?

1034
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,090
Let go of me.

1035
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:40,910
Just because I like men,

1036
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,800
you think I go crazy over all of them?

1037
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,270
Isn't that too simplistic?

1038
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,070
Listen carefully.

1039
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,610
My preference has nothing to do with the sexes.

1040
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:51,970
I'm a human who likes another human.

1041
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,930
What's so different about that?

1042
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:58,040
A jerk like you, who's busy bullying
someone who seems weak...

1043
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,720
I wouldn't want a truckload of them.

1044
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,590
The fact that you're holding me like this

1045
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,650
is disgusting and unpleasant, too.

1046
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,410
Let go!

1047
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,680
Hey!

1048
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,920
That's enough.

1049
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,970
Didn't you hear what the bastard said?

1050
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:21,700
Go and study more if you have time for this. Leave.

1051
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,200
Leave!

1052
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,100
Whenever I found someone I loved,

1053
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,710
unpleasant things happened more

1054
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,930
than pleasant things.

1055
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,020
And in those moments, Joon Seok helped me.

1056
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,990
- Hello?
- Where are you?

1057
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,210
- I'm in Gangnam.
- I'm in Gangnam, too.

1058
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,330
Did you get off work early?

1059
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,740
No, I did fieldwork.

1060
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,360
- Do assistants do fieldwork, too?
- Yeah.

1061
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,690
Are you in a bad mood by chance?
Did something happen?

1062
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,610
No, it's not like that.

1063
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,770
Let's have a drink since you're in Gangnam.

1064
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,980
- Come to JJ.
- Okay.

1065
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:11,410
♫ It's so hard for me to even rest ♫

1066
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:15,340
♫ But you don't seem to be like that ♫

1067
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,770
♫ How could we break up? ♫

1068
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:23,480
♫ I can't even see you ♫

1069
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,870
Liking a straight man

1070
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,480
never worked out.

1071
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,840
Thinking Mr. Shin would be different...

1072
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,510
Was it my imagination?

1073
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,730
I told you.

1074
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,930
Getting involved with a straight man can never be good.

1075
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:52,230
Geez, how could that comic artist be like this?

1076
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,820
He did that to you when he had a girlfriend.

1077
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,410
Drop it.

1078
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,610
Let's stop talking about that.

1079
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,550
Do you want another drink?

1080
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,990
Right!

1081
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,330
Don't be surprised.

1082
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,420
There are a lot of gay couples here.

1083
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,940
Gay couples?

1084
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,590
I know the people who own this place.

1085
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,660
But they're a gay couple.

1086
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,860
That's why a lot of customers are gay couples.

1087
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,150
But the culture is more open these days.

1088
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,420
You're okay with that, right?

1089
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,110
Yeah, sure.

1090
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,470
Let's go!

1091
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,620
Gay couples?

1092
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,910
I thought I had nothing to do with that.

1093
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:42,990
Let me pay this time.

1094
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:45,860
It's okay! I'll pay since you're feeling down.

1095
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,820
Let me pay.

1096
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,230
No!

1097
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,970
Ji Min!

1098
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,470
I know the people who own this place.

1099
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:04,960
But they're a gay couple.

1100
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,210
That's why a lot of couples are gay couples.

1101
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,530
Mr. Shin.

1102
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,680
How...

1103
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,150
Mu Yeong!

1104
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,010
Who's the person sitting next to you?

1105
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,020
Well, this is...

1106
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:25,390
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Joon Seok.

1107
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,130
Yes.

1108
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,870
There are a lot of gay couples here.

1109
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,540
Why is he here...

1110
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,590
My goodness!

1111
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,030
What's going on?

1112
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,520
My gosh, my gosh!

1113
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,200
- They're really going for it. My gosh!
- I know.

1114
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:22,630
♫ I'm broken because of you ♫

1115
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:27,530
♫ My hands get fidgety when you approach me ♫

1116
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:32,630
♫ It's expressing how I feel, I don't even know how I feel ♫

1117
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,830
♫ It's a problem ♫

1118
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,310
♫ I can't seem to hide it ♫

1119
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,070
It was uncharacteristically childish of me.

1120
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:56,910
But seeing Mu Yeong being tempted

1121
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,400
made me angry, and I couldn't help it.

1122
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,300
I guess Mu Yeong has always been like that.

1123
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,130
What are you doing at the academy?

1124
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,200
I heard you won 2nd place.

1125
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,340
Congratulations.

1126
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,920
It was just a small competition within the academy.

1127
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,420
But still.

1128
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,690
Since it's you, I wanted to tell you congratulations.

1129
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,680
Is this it?

1130
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,660
You did a good job.

1131
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:47,330
Mine is nothing compared to this one.

1132
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,610
Did that win the 1st place?

1133
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:51,270
Yours looks better to me.

1134
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,790
That's him, isn't it?

1135
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,080
What?

1136
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,310
The one you like.

1137
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,370
- No, it's not like that.
- Come on.

1138
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,430
Your eyes are telling me that right now.

1139
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,780
Will you tell him how you feel?

1140
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,700
No.

1141
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,680
If I do,

1142
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,420
I'm sure he'd struggle, too.

1143
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,790
I don't want to get hurt anymore.

1144
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:34,510
I don't... want to hurt anyone, either.

1145
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,540
Whenever you fell in love with someone,

1146
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,950
you completely fell for him
and loved everything about him.

1147
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:44,090
And no one else mattered to you except for him.

1148
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,860
I need to go now.

1149
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,930
- Thank you for the present.
- Yeah, sure.

1150
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,760
You haven't changed at all since.

1151
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,910
How come Mu Yeong never learns his lessons?

1152
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:08,550
He wastes his emotions even though he's older now.

1153

Anyway, when I kissed you,

1154
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,500
I suddenly had this thought.

1155
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,050
If it were you,

1156
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:21,040
I could do much more than that.

1157
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:38,540
I ran away because I was so shocked yesterday.

1158
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,270
I don't know how to deal with it.

What's the deal?

1161
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,480
Is he pretending like he didn't see it?

1162
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,980
What should I do?

1163
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,790
It's awkward. I feel like
I had a crush on someone with a girlfriend-

1164
01:12:55,790 --> 01:13:00,040
No, I feel like I had a crush on a man
who had a boyfriend.

1165
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,840
A crush.

1166

A... A crush?

1167
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,350
- So awkward.
- I mean...

1168
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,830
he should just say something!

1169
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,810
- Well, Mu Yeong.
- Yes!

1170
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,480
Let's use this for the background...

1171
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,340
Well, no! Um...

1172
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,570
Thinking about it,
I think another background would be better.

1173

Are you crazy?

1174
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,500
A picture of the bar? Use that as a background?

1175
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,660
Which place should I use then?

1176
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,220
Well, I... Um...

Yes. Well...

- Pardon?

Yes. He's my boyfriend.

Mu Yeong is quitting?

1248

I sent this before I took a shower.

1315
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:55,200
He hasn't seen it yet.

1316
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,490
Okay.

1317
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,680
To work from home for now,

1318
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,180
I need to grab my stuff anyway.

1319
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,490
Mr. Shin, I'm here to grab my stuff...

1320
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,920
Is no one here?

1321
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,650
The bottles...

1322
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:34,800
How much did he drink anyway?

1323
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,960
Mr. Shin.

1324
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:47,110
He looks tired.

1325
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,610
I wonder how he felt.

1326
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,850
Wait...

1327
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:58,930
What's the point of worrying when I'm ending things?

1328
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,900
Mr. Shin, I liked you a lot.

1329
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,830
Take care.

1330
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:09,060
Don't go, Mu Yeong.

1331
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,620
♫ I think of you all day ♫

1332
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,270
Mu Yeong.

1333
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,380
Don't be with him.

1334
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,140
I can't move.

1335
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,680
Don't go.

1336
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,110
Please be by my side.

1337
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:27,530
Mu Yeong.

1338
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,570
Mu Yeong!

1339
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,860
Don't go, Mu Yeong!

1340
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:39,350
♫ Meeting you and seeing you off was my routine ♫

1341
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:46,370
♫ I'm standing in front of your
house because of that habit ♫

1342
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:48,540
♫ I hope we run into each other... ♫

1343
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,820
What? Mu Yeong!

1344
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,870
Mu Yeong, I'm sorry.

1345
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:00,090
I was sure I was dreaming.

1346
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:02,210
I thought there's no way you'd come here-

1347
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:06,050
I texted you that I'd be picking up my stuff.

1348
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,570
I didn't see it.

1349
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,890
I'm sorry.

1350
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,560
But still...

1351
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,100
I'm glad you woke up.

1352
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,080
I'll go and take a quick shower. I'm so sweaty.

1353
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,460
Let's eat together.

1354
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:20,860
Well, why...

1355
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,630
Don't go, please?

1356
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:25,180
I have something to tell you, too. Okay?

1357
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,710
Okay.

1358
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,090
Yes.

1359
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,160
Don't go.

1360
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,230
Don't go!

1361
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,820
Don't go, Mu Yeong!

1362
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,730
"Don't go, Mu Yeong."

1363
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:46,380
I keep thinking about it.

1364
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,140
Producer Lee?

1365
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:54,760
Hello, Mr. Ko.

1366
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,620
Where's Mr. Shin?

1367
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,270
He's taking a shower.

1368
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,400
I came by because I couldn't reach him.

1369
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,820
I keep telling him not to make me come here.

1370
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:09,520
I couldn't have been cursed to repeat the same day, right?

1371
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,010
Or am I in the deadline blackhole?

1372
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,240
I need to send the draft right now.

1373
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,500
Why is she telling me that?

1374
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,100
Why don't you talk to him when he comes out?

1375
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,570
Well, okay.

1376
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,300
I thought we'd miss the deadline this time.

1377
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,030
I was so, so scared.

1378
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:36,860
But I'm so relieved that
we have you as his assistant, Mr. Ko.

1379
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,390
Looks like you're working late tonight.

1380
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,110
No, I...

1381
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:43,900
I see.

1382
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,170
What? When did you come?

1383
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,180
What is this?

1384
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,160
This is him, right? Your friend Ko Mu-

1385
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,480
You think acting rashly is your charm.

1386
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,690
But you're wrong.

1387
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:27,530
I didn't know why you coddled him so much, Oppa.

1388
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,830
But now I know why.

1389
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,180
It's not like that, Yoon Ah.

1390
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,870
It might be hard to believe,

1391
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:39,300
- but we faked it for a reason-
- Really?

1392
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,510
It looks too affectionate to be fake.

1393
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,330
Who took these?

1394
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,650
If I upload these photos,
you won't be able to get married, right?

1395
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:50,540
Everyone at your work would find out, too.

1396
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,230
And your parents, too.

1397
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,690
Wouldn't your position at work be in danger, too-

1398
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:58,620
So what do you want to do?

1399
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:03,770
Tell our parents that we called off the wedding
because of you.

1400
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,210
You don't love me.

1401
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:16,310
Mu Yeong, you haven't left, right?

1402
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,310
No, but more importantly,

1403
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:19,600
Producer Lee is here-

1404
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,180
I thought you might be angry
because I kissed you suddenly.

1405
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,670
I'll just dry off quickly and come out.

1406
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,060
It's not like that.

1407
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,690
It's not like that.

1408
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:32,960
Mr. Shin did it in his sleep...

1409
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,100
I'm sorry for touching your waist, too.

1410
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,340
I touched your body without realizing it.

1411
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,940
I got so sweaty.

1412
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:45,130
You got covered in my sweat because of me.

1413
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:46,940
Congratulations.

1414
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,380
You're still there, right?

1415
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:49,670
Please wait a bit.

1416
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:51,390
Producer Lee! It's not like that!

1417
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,820
Wait!

1418
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,430
It's okay.

1419
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:57,080
Love comes first.

1420
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,350
I'll request a hiatus.

1421
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:02,990
My gosh!

1422
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,240
Mu Yeong.

1423
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,520
Producer Min Yeong was here just now.

1424
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,340
What? Why?

1425
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,010
That's not what's important.

1426
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,470
She heard you yelling from the bathroom.

1427
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,180
Geez!

1428
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:26,720
I'm sorry.

1429
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,520
I'll explain it to Producer Lee.

1430
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,970
Of course, He and Producer Lee were...

1431
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:37,950
I'll explain it well to her,
so you don't get affected by it.

1432
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,390
I'm sorry.

1433
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,270
It's okay.

1434
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,340
I think I should get going, too.

1435
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,270
Let's eat some other time.

1436
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,950
Mu Yeong.

1437
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:56,860
You quit this job because of me, right?

1438
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,800
No.

1439
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,010
It's my fault.

1440
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:04,050
You don't have to lie to me.

1441
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,590
No, it's really my fault!

1442
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:08,590
I wanted to quit...

1443
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,490
acting foolish.

1444
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,920
By "acting foolish,"

1445
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,090
you mean drawing comics?

1446
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,300
No.

1447
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,800
What?

1448
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,140
Liking you.

1449
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:26,140
What did you just say...

1450
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,690
You like what?

1451
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,770
Just pretend you didn't hear me.

1452
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:34,990
Please...

1453
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,780
Please say it again.

1454
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,210
I'm going to quit acting foolish.

1455
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,630
Not that.

1456
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,220
You said you like me.

1457
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:49,200
I wanted to hear those words.

1458
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,990
Don't quit.

1459
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:01,430
- Being your assistant?
- No.

1460
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,490
Liking me.

1461
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:08,040
Please keep liking me.

1462
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,850
As long as you like me,

1463
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:12,230
I'll stop worrying about other complicated stuff.

1464
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,360
I know it's not my place to say this,

1465
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,660
but break up with him.

1466
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,070
Excuse me?

1467
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:24,320
I like Mu Yeong?

1468
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,590
You should see the person you like.

1469
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:28,760
You want me to see the person I like?

1470
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:31,920
Honestly, you meet Mu Yeong often

1471
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,730
and you always run to him when he calls you.

1472
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:37,010
Is that so?

1473
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:38,310
I don't remember.

1474
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:43,450
Anyway, what I'm saying is
you should be with the one you really like.

1475
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:44,870
I said it's not like that.

1476
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:47,020
If not, do you have a crush on him or something?

1477
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,700
How dare you.

1478
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:55,860
That's enough.

1479
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,450
You really like him, don't you?

1480
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:10,140
You never showed me your honest face like that.

1481
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:16,510
I just took care of my naive friend
so he doesn't get hurt.

1482
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,720
I'm by his side when he needs me.

1483
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,520
I have fun when I'm with him...

1484
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,980
and happy.

1485
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,860
I guess I do... like him.

1486
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:45,540
- I like you.
- I like you.

1487
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,220
So, please...

1488
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,640
please like me only.

1489
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:55,440
Can't you...

1490
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,700
break up with him?

1491
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,630
Why don't you end your relationship first?

1492
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:03,830
What do you mean?

1493
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:05,430
Producer Min Yeong.

1494
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,340
I know you have a special relationship with her-

1495
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:08,890
I do?

1496
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:12,820
Aren't you... two dating?

1497
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,180
No.

1498
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,620
There's no way.

1499
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:17,460
Do you just sleep together, then?

1500
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,880
What...

1501
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,310
Who do you think I am?

1502
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:26,020
But you went to a hotel together
and you held hands at the cafe, too.

1503
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,050
We were there to do photo research.

1504
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:35,280
And I gave her my hands to learn how to make a knot.

1505
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,480
So you two...

1506
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,950
Of course, we're nothing.

1507
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,590
I see.

1508
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:45,580
So...

1509
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,130
you guys are breaking up now, right?

1510
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,970
To be honest...

1511
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:54,180
we pretended to be a couple.

1512
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,400
He's a friend of mine.

1513
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,880
What did you say?

1514
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,710
I was so hurt because of that.

1515
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:02,290
Why did you do that?

1516
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:07,100
It's because I thought you kissed me
while you were dating Producer Min Yeong.

1517
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,620
Out of anger...

1518
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:11,800
How could you do that?

1519
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,360
Do you know how I felt?

1520
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:19,940
I'm...

1521
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,670
really happy right now.

1522
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:28,140
I like you, Mu Yeong.

1523
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,720
Me, too, Mr. Shin.

1524
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,850
By the way,

1525
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:38,750
how did you know we went to a hotel and held hands?

1526
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,730
Well, the thing is...

1527
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,620
Excuse me.

1528
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,270
- Yes.
- This is Ko Mu Yeong, right?

1529
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:51,330
Joon Seok oppa got into an accident.

1530
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:53,120
- He's at a hospital right now.
- What?

1531
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,580
Would you be able to come here?

1532
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,450
Yes.

1533
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:01,560
Mr. Shin, I think I should get going now.

1534
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,850
Where?

1535
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,770
Joon Seok got into an accident.

1536
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,840
Let's talk later, then.

1537
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,080
Wait, Mu Yeong...

1538
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,520
What timing.

1539
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,270
You're Ko Mu Yeong, right?

1540
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:34,050
Yoon Ah?

1541
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,740
What happened?

1542
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:43,080
He got into an accident on his way home.

1543
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,050
Thankfully, he wasn't seriously injured.

1544
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:47,950
He just got a cast, and that was it.

1545
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,890
But you know...

1546
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,030
could you be by his side

1547
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:57,720
until he recovers?

1548
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,950
Pardon?

1549
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,440
We broke up.

1550
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,410
- What-
- I actually know you guys' relationship.

1551
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,730
- I think you're mistaken-
- You might be treating it lightly,

1552
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,260
but Oppa isn't.

1553
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,050
He really likes you.

1554
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,850
Thank you in advance.

1555
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:25,050
♫ I wonder if it was ♫

1556
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:31,910
♫ After letting go of everything ♫

1557
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:36,770
♫ I think about it again ♫

01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:41,320
♫ But I can't help myself ♫

1559
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:44,820
♫ Thinking of you all day ♫

1560
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:47,750
♫ It's so hard for me ♫

1561
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,060
Are you okay?

1562
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:51,400
Yes.

1563
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,990
♫ But you don't seem to be ♫

1564
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:56,660
When I fully recover,

1565
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,930
I'm thinking of just being in a foolish relationship.

1566
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,330
Aren't you curious?

1567
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:07,130
What?

1568
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,240
Aren't you curious...

1569
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:12,200
about my foolish relationship?

1570
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:20,740
What happened... with Yoon Ah?

1571
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,950
Do you know how it feels
when you can't do anything your way?

1572
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,080
Since I was a kid, choosing which school to attend,

1573
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,850
what kind of career to have,

1574
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,770
and even who to marry...

1575
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,150
I wasn't always interested in Mu Yeong.

1576
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,230
- He was refreshing.
- Hey!

1577
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:57,570
You'd better stop that.

1578
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:00,790
Being able to talk about the things that are

1579
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:02,580
considered as taboos in society.

1580
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,240
That's enough.

1581
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:06,500
Being able to...

1582
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,150
express how you feel exactly.

1583
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:15,370
I thought it was correct to live like others,

1584
01:38:15,370 --> 01:38:17,820
and it came across as a pleasant shock.

1585
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,090
And one day,

1586
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:24,270
Mu Yeong got to like someone.

1587
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:25,940
He tried to hide it,

1588
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,370
but I could tell.

1589
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:32,160
That Mu Yeong liked him.

1590
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,150
And...

1591
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,580
There's one thing I finally realized.

1592
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,150
That I...

1593
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,970
like Mu Yeong, too.

1594
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:01,470
What? What is it?

1595
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:07,580
I mean, just because.

1596
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:12,020
I guess you feel better now.

1597
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:15,680
Hey, Ko Mu Yeong.

1598
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,560
You know, I had said...

1599
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,930
"I'm thinking of just being in a foolish relationship."

1600
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,810
Do you remember that?

1601
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:30,700
You know I broke up with Yoon Ah
before the accident, right?

1602
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,130
When I thought I might die at the moment,

1603
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:39,670
I decided I needed to be honest about my feelings.

1604
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:41,590
What would you die?

1605
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,820
I feel bad for Yoon Ah,

1606
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,530
but I think I always liked someone else.

1607
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:55,280
So, I'm trying to tell the person how I feel,

1608
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,710
but I'm not so well right now.

1609
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,550
So I'll tell later.

1610
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:09,050
I think I will confess my feelings when my treatment ends.

1611
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:17,420
Aren't you even curious about who it is?

1612
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,680
Later.

1613
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,940
Tell me later. When you fully recover.

1614
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,590
Mu Yeong.

1615
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:35,700
Please be by my side until I take the cast off.

1616

- Joon Seok.
- Please do that for me.

1617

whenever you faced hardships, too.

1619

01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:12,080
Yes, is something the matter?

1649

Han Joon Seok disappeared.

- Pardon?
- I think you need to come right now.

I'm sorry, Mr. Shin.

What?

Joon Seok apparently disappeared.

There's nothing you can do even if you go now.

Why do you have to do all that?

He has a family and a caretaker, too.

I'm the only friend he has.

I'll stop seeing you.

Mu Yeong, should I step aside?

01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,030
I'm your boyfriend.

But I feel like I'm interfering with you two.

1674

You came.

1675
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:50,340
I ran over because I heard you had disappeared.

1676

Did you lie?

1677
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:56,670
You wouldn't have come so quickly otherwise.

1678
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:58,850
If you were with that comic artist,

1679
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:01,140
you would've taken longer.

1680

This isn't even the first time. What's with you?

1681

I'm leaving.

1682
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,620
I called you because I have something to show you.

I said I wanted to confess my love to someone?

1686

I do remember.

1687
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:31,640
So I'm thinking of doing it now.

1688

No matter how much I think about it,

1691
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,600
it's irrational,

unreasonable,

1693

and illogical.

Sorry.

1700

I'm sorry.

1701
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,390
Is that your answer?

1702
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:49,430
You're a really good friend.

Well, I expected you'd react this way.

He's not even calling me, huh?

1710
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,080
Forget it. I'm not interested, either.

1711
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,860

you thought I'd wait for you like a fool?

01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:55,840
You're the only one for me.

1807
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,700
You mean it, right?

1808
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:01,300
Right?

1809
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,770
Yes!

1810
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:05,280
Are you that happy?

1811
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,250
Yes, of course, I am.

1812
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:10,460
Right, Mu Yeong.

1813
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,800
- Should we live together?
- Yes.

1814
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,380
What?

1815
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:17,770
You agreed to live with me, okay?

1816
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:20,810
I'll think about it if you can meet my conditions.

1817
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:22,360
Let's hear it.

1818
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,990
I'll meet all of them.
