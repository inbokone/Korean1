00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,510
Honey, did you have an affair with that bitch?

166
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,740
Babe, didn't you say you loved me?

167
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,960
Well, Visitor. You need to decide now.

168
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,720
Which one do you want to take a photo with?

169
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,620
With me, of course, Oppa.

170
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,460
Come to your senses, Honey.

171
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,820
What are you looking at? Look at me.

172
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,920
- Honey.
- Come here.

173
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
Hold on!

174
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm not sure.

175
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,620
Who did he end up taking it with?

176
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,500
His wife, of course, right?

177
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,060
There's nothing more desperate than love.

178
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,580
He left comfortably holding his girlfriend's hand.

179
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,740
I need to get going.

181
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,100
Where did you say it was?

182
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,080
- Pardon?
- The flower shop.

183
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,670
Gosh, it's cold.

184
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,970
Why is it so cold in the middle of summer?

185
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,880
Feeling cold makes me hungry.

186
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,990
What's this smell?

187
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,960
- Should I try some?
- Bam!

188
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,260
It still has 30 seconds to go.

189
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,460
You're supposed to cook pork belly for a minute and 30 seconds, flipping once-

190
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,210
Who's the little brat-

191

Hey, how could you eat this alone?

192
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,250
Three people live in this house, but only the two of you?

193
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,250
Mr. Seo, I didn't think you were like this.

I thought you were working late today.

196
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,500
You're not even interested when your only roommate is coming home.

197
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh, were you busy dating?

198
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,830
Dating, my foot.

199
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,360
I was going to call you, anyway. Sit, sit.

200
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,070
But why are you sitting so far apart from each other?

201
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,710
Gosh, why are you so shy at your age?

202
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,760
Go, go.

203
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,710
Why is the intern girl here?

204
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,400
What's wrong with this?

205
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,340
And why is the table leg broken?

206
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,680
Hey, don't you work late too often these days?

207
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,550
How could they make you go home in the morning?

208
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,280
That chief is no good.

209
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,070
There's someone worse than the chief.

210
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
A ghost bastard.

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,700
Which company do you work for?

212
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,240
Oh, I wonder if you know.

Ji Won always got good grades since she was a kid.

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,160
She used to work for a bigger corporation before.

217
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,960
She would've been a section chief by now if she kept working.

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,540
I know someone who used to work there.

It's okay. It's okay.

Gosh, what was that?

225
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,070
Didn't a cup move by itself just now?

- Pardon?
- What?

Huh?

How could a cup move on its own?

You must be very tired. Go get some sleep.

It's soju.

I burnt incense over it. Drink it.

Someone I know drinks it whenever they're having a hard time.

It doesn't taste too bad.

Since Na Rae told me to make sure to catch him,

316
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,920
I had no choice but to come back.

So she won't have to blame herself forever for saying that.

318

asking for a divorce.

We were together for eight years, including when we dated.

I thought I knew her better than anyone.

But I don't recognize the Na Rae I'm seeing right now.

The face I used to see every day seems unfamiliar.

324
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,360
I think I might actually kill someone at this rate.

325
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,600
Do you want me to kill him?

326
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,970
I could make a ghost show up at his home and give him nightmares.

327

I could bring a few evil spirits to the flower shop and make him die slowly.

328
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,560
I could get him possessed and make him go crazy.

329
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,830
What would you like me to do?

330
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,540
That'd be a crime.

331
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,730
But...

332
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,610
it's better than you turning into an evil spirit.

333
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,860
You know you'd become an evil spirit if you resent this world deeply.

334
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,110
Just like Choi Hoon.

335

We don't have a visitor tomorrow. I'll let you rest for a few days.

Mr. Seo, did you have lunch?

339
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,400
Yes.

340
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,720
What's for dinner tonight?

341
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,430

Good luck. Fighting.

Okay?

345
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,560
Did he say "Okay" again?

346
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,910
How come he answers with less than three characters?

347
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,940
Geez, seriously.

Do you have a trial today?

351
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,760
Yes, it's an urgent commercial building lawsuit. I need to eat quickly and go.

352
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,210
You've been suspicious lately.

353
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,820
The Yoon So Myeong case and the Choi Hoon case. How are you getting so many cases?

354
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,960
Having the law firm next to the photo studio...

355
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,310
Did opening the law firm up on that hill really work?

I guess you could call it the night world.

360

Are you very stressed out lately?

361
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,800
Because Lee Hyeon Oh became the minister?

362
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,050
Please tell us how you feel.

Whatever. I won't get involved with him anymore.

He calls instant coffee "normal coffee."

00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,020
♫ Yes ♫

652
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:56,060
♫ Because I couldn't do what I wanted to do for you ♫

653
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:03,460
♫ Even if my feelings for you come back ♫

654
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,320
♫ In every moment of my life, I'll only stay by your side ♫

655
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,480
What? Did you come here looking for me?

656
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,240
You couldn't wait even for a moment?

657
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,110
You can't sleep because you miss me, right?

658
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,560
Jang Soo.

659
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,390
That was my nickname when I was a kid.

660
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,830
How did you know?

661
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,410
Did Ji Won tell you?

662
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,970
That scar...

663
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,310
Can I have a look at it?

664
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,250
Fine.

665
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,920
But you can't call it ugly, okay?

666
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,510
You were alive.

667
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,070
Mr. Seo.

668
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,430
You were alive.

669
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,390
So, I went to the studio while I was unconscious?

670
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,150
And I was the thuggish kid you mentioned?

671
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,610
I can't even imagine.

672
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,740
I met Seo Ki Joo when I was 15.

673
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,230
By the way, why don't I remember it?

674
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,520
Because you were unconscious then.

675
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,380
In rare cases, the souls of people who are alive come, thinking they are dead.

676
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,120
I thought you died because you suddenly disappeared.

677
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,550
It's so fascinating.

678
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,220
I reunited with Seo Ki Joo at age 35 after seeing him when I was 15.

679
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,420
Have you heard of something called "timed fate"?

680
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,830
They say all the people you're destined to meet come at a certain time.

681
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,520
You're destined to meet those people, even if you didn't try.

682
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,540
Just like us.

683
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,050
Yes.

684
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,730
What was I like when I was 12?

685
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,990
You were mean.

686
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,780
- Pardon?
- You were ill-tempered.

687
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,440
You destroyed everything and threw tantrums.

688
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,040
Seriously.

689
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,980
Are you sure you're happy to see me again?

690
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,530
Thanks to that troublemaker, I survived.

691
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,470
When I didn't want to do anything because Uncle disappeared,

692
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,680
Jang Soo came and caused trouble every day.

693
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,770
So I didn't get a chance to think about Uncle.

694
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,690
I really saved your life, then.

695
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,610
Aren't you so grateful, Seo Ki Joo?

696
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,500
By the way,

697
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,300
why are you talking to me casually since earlier?

698
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,800
I don't think I would've spoken formally due to my temper.

699
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,620
Are you offended? Talk to me casually, too, then.

700
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,340
You really are Jang Soo.

701
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,580
But that ill-tempered kid came back as the safe zone.

702
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,350
Thinking about it, what would you have done if you never met me?

703
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,860
You wouldn't have had the safe zone.

704
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,830
I'm the one who created it, okay?

705
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,060
What do you mean by that?

706
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,890
Because of a kid who was afraid of ghosts when she was a ghost,

707
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,080
I used salt to...

708
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,710
create the circle carefully.

709
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,570
Stay in this circle.

710
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,910
Stay close to me.

711
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,780
- Really?
- I'll protect you.

712
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,030
When you disappeared back then,

713
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,590
I really thought you were dead.

714
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,370
But you're by my side now.

715
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,470
That's why the safe zone gets activated when we're together.

716
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,380
Because you created it for me.

717
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,440
Thank you...

718
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,980
for always saving me in dangerous moments.

719
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,530
I want to live a very long time now.

720
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,530
A very long time.

721
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,290
Right, my phone got confiscated.

722
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,030
Ta-da.

723
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,070
You're the first person I'm giving it to.

724
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,310
Make sure to come.

725
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:51,300
Gosh, I'm sure she's waiting for my call.

726
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,780
I should just get going.

727
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,730
So cold! Did the boiler die again?

728
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,980
Let's see...

729
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,330
[Seo Joon and Yoon Hee]

730
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,340
You're the one who framed me, aren't you?

731
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,840
Who are you?

732
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,450
I need to stop by somewhere today. I'll be back late.

733
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,030
I'll pick you up if it gets late.

734
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,730
Mr. Seo, you said you're going to the Pitcairn Islands with your uncle, right?

735
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,410
Go with me if he doesn't come back in time.

736
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,270
I can't help myself because I'm nervous.

737
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,980
The population is small there. You'd be the most handsome man there.

738
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,770
How annoying.

739
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,040
Okay. Let's make sure to go together.

740
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,400
What's going on...

741
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,130
- Look at the window.
- Look at it.

742
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,360
Look at all the blood. Did they use a brick...

743
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,840
Look at that.

744
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,240
You haven't found the culprit yet?

745
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,020
M-Mr. Seo.

746
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,170
Mr. Seo.

747
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,130
What happened?

748
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,580
An evil spirit came last night.

749
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,140
Gosh. It stinks over here.

750
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,140
Mr. Seo, I've been calling you since the crack of dawn. You finally came.

751
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,520
The police searched the studio and interrogated people in the area.

752
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,840
It was a mess.

753
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,720
Yes, I had something to do.

754
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh, I see.

755
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,710
Where were you between two and three in the morning when the incident happened?

756
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,380
- I was outside of Seoul.
- I see.

757
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,760
Who could prove your alibi?

758
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,570
Am I a suspect?

759
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,040
No.

760
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,750
Oh, I'm investigating the case now.

761
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,890
We've been receiving calls about cats getting killed lately.

762
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,300
According to our investigation,

763
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,740
all the cats were strangely killed around your photo studio.

764
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,090
But...

765
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,780
it happened in front of your house this time.

766
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,650
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

767
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,320
Yes.

768
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,750
Are you saying I'm the culprit right now?

769
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,610
I wouldn't have done this unless I'm crazy.

770
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,130
Why would I have ruined my studio?

771
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:21,050
I didn't say you're the culprit.

772
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,900
Please leave if you have nothing to say. I have a business to run.

773
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,500
When do you open?

774
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,170
- Probably the same as other businesses.
- Apparently not.

775
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,830
You open at night and close at dawn. You only have one or two customers, too.

776
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,240
Mr. Seo,

777
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,130
do you know what we call a place like this?

778
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,460
A fake storefront.

779
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,720
What are you trying to disguise, exactly?

780
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,110
Please leave.

781
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:54,770
A terrorist attack like this is usually committed by someone

782
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,700
antisocial with a twisted desire to exhibit themselves.

783
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,170
For example, someone who frequents the police station

784
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:07,490
or claims attention by causing trouble often.

785
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:13,920
An officer should investigate, not hypothesize.

786
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,580
I agree.

787
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,660
I'll be in touch again.

788
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,440
Don't move to a different place again.

789

M-Mr. Seo, are you okay?

790
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,770
- Where's the camera?
- Thankfully, the evil spirit couldn't enter the studio.

791
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,780
B-But the fact that an evil spirit came this far means-

792
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,660
It means my death is approaching.

Why are you back so late?
