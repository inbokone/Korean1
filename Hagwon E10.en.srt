00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.560
I don't it's a consultation.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.130
He said you'd know the name Pyo Sang Seob.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.700
Is something up?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.630
Yes.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.170
Someone's here to see me.

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:24.870
Ms. Seo.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:27.879
Mr. Pyo Sang Seob's here. Do you know why...

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.180
He's here to see me.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.180
It has been a while.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
Yes.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.390
It has been a while, Mr. Pyo.

Pyo Sang Seob.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.090
Pyo Sang Seob?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.859
I heard that name before.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.340
Wait.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.610
Oh, gosh.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.009
Please take a seat.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.979
What's going on? Don't you even knock...

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.050
What are you doing?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.719
Shoot. I can't hear a word.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.030
I just don't know what he's here about.

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.580
There's no need to be too nervous.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.280
I just came by to say hello.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.719
That makes me even more nervous.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.150
I don't think we were close enough to say hello.

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:53.990
We met...

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.520
after the mid-term, right?

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.729
Once in the school teachers' office,

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.500
and then at a Japanese restaurant.

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.539
We met twice.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.770
Yes.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.710
Since then,

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.340
I felt like we were always together.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.650
As teachers.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.449
But please excuse me...

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.419
I can't bring myself to refer to you as a teacher.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.490
Are you surprised I called you a teacher?

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.360
Yes. A bit.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.930
I should apologize first.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.970
You really never know where life will take you.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.310
I was too rash.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.379
I didn't think I'd throw in the towel.

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.959
Do you not get what I mean?

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.459
I don't. Can you explain so I do?

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.230
Why did you feel like we were always together?

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.730
And what's this about throwing in the towel?

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.810
I quit as a schoolteacher.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.379
To be more exact, I submitted my resignation.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.420
There still are some formalities.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.889
The Office of Education and principal must approve.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.290
It's a complicated process.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.459
What did you just say?

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.430
I'm sorry, I mean...

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.759
What are you saying?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.199
I mean why...

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.300
Why did you make that decision?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.739
It's a bit awkward to say...

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.839
I made the decision.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.480
I just wonder...

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.649
if it were meant to be this way.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.449
- Is this about... - Yes.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:07.790
Ever since that day in the teachers' office.

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.230
I need you...

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.860
to explain in detail so I get it.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.600
Did you go over our final exam?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.439
- Yes. - How did you find it?

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:25.909
Why would you ask me that?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.110
I don't exist to evaluate school exams.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.990
"Chanyoung High's exams are always well thought-out."

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.259
"The options were quite refreshing."

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.360
Isn't that...

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.129
what you said?

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.860
Don't you remember?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.339
I said that to mean I understood the intention behind the question.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.040
I see.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.540
Ever since...

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.079
you paid a visit to my school,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.980
I became...

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.420
a mess.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.860
I said I'd show you the strength of public education...

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:18.860
that an academy could never infringe upon.

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.560
That thought poisoned me.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.230
After that day,

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.930
academies were all I could think about.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.339
"How do academies teach this passage?"

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.980
"Do academies teach this as a whole?"

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.480
"Would academies think this question was well thought-out?"

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.680
Academies, academies...

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:46.720
Academies.

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:53.029
I guess...

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.060
that's why it felt like I taught my students with you...

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:59.670
for the rest of the semester.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.069
I'm quite stupid for realizing that only now.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.579
You didn't have to resign over that.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:15.519
Did you hear what I told the students after that?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.050
That's you'd use passages from the textbook.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.489
Zero related passages.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.660
Short essay questions.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.689
That was the exam guideline.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.589
Did you hear the reason...

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:28.360
for those guidelines?

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.470
No, I didn't get to hear that.

00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:34.740
You wouldn't have.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.569
Because I never got to explain.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.379
I had prepared a fancy speech...

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.350
to give to whoever...

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.350
asked me about it.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.549
What it means...

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.250
to read through and master the textbook.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.789
What it is that I want to teach the students.

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.129
But no one asked.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:06.470
The ill-tempered lashings out of a teacher...

00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:09.100
who was humiliated...

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.509
by an academy instructor.

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:14.679
That was all it became.

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:22.279
I'm not offended.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:23.950
If I think about it,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.090
I wasn't entirely innocent or naive.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.398
Whether it's a class or an exam question,

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.970
for a teacher to doubt... No.

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:44.370
To verify themselves.

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:47.940
I think...

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:51.080
that's a must.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.110
Yes. It is.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.149
However,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.889
I'm ruined.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.059
The students...

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:10.559
and teachers...

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.799
consider me a time bomb.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.269
About the mid-term question.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.139
I didn't lodge a complaint through a board meeting...

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:26.309
On the outside,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.980
it was to handle it quickly.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.990
But on the inside...

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.690
Wasn't it a rumor that you wanted?

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.600
For no one but yourself.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.139
That's the conclusion...

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.909
I reached after looking back on that day hundreds of times.

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:56.678
If you had admitted from the start...

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:58.378
that there were two possible answers...

00:10:58.379 --> 00:10:59.450
Then...

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:03.450
the students and parents alike would consider you...

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:05.190
a hero.

00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:09.259
Even if the fight were to snowball...

00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:12.590
Even if...

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:15.159
you didn't get what you wanted, it would've still worked for you.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.230
You'd be called a fighter...

00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:21.740
who took on a school.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.870
In other words,

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.539
you had...

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.580
two outcomes which were both favorable.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:36.179
And I...

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:39.990
was trapped.

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:44.960
I heard that in the academy world,

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:48.529
what instructors need the most are rumors.

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:53.070
And rumors are also the most dangerous.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.909
The rumor that you bashed into someone's fortress.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.210
And we want the one in power to be angry.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.210
Anger will turn to interest,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.080
and that'll become a value that can't be measured by money.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.190
Yes?

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.080
No one's allowed to come in.

00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:39.179
- Ms. Seo. - Leave, Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:45.720
I see.

00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:49.190
Is this the Lee Jun Ho?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.169
I heard a lot about you.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.129
I'm Pyo Sang Seob.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.870
Hello.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.309
Starting with this winter break,

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:10.940
I will work at Choisun Academy.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:17.450
Mr. Lee.

00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:20.649
I'd wanted to meet you too,

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:23.289
but would you mind if today...

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.559
I speak just with Ms. Seo?

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.960
Sure, that's fine.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.960
I'll leave you to talk.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.710
(Consultation Room 2)

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:50.450
What's going on?

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.419
I don't know.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.019
He's from Choisun Academy.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.360
What do you mean? He's Chanyoung High's...

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:00.990
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:03.659
It's because of what she did.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:06.230
What did she do?

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.500
Don't you remember?

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.769
The new instructors don't know.

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:14.009
We hired them after the mid-term exam.

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.809
Do you think...

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.549
I'll be able to start my career as an instructor...

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.620
with a crazy rumor?

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.620
Would there be a point in apologizing...

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:30.690
Why apologize?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.789
If it hadn't been for that,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.059
I'd never have realized.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.330
- You are... - What it means to help the kids.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.440
What teaching Korean is really about. To be honest,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.309
it's possible I didn't even care about that.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.110
I thought...

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:59.319
you had more pride and self-respect...

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.490
than anyone as a schoolteacher.

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:04.929
Your students must respect you a lot.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.830
That's what I believed.

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:14.470
I saw something interesting in your lobby.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.470
The Hall of Fame.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.809
Could there be anything...

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.879
that boosts your pride and honor...

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.250
as sending more students to a top university?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.189
Sending our students to a good university...

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.820
is our pride and joy.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.889
- Let's work together. - Let's work together.

00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:46.799
How did you choose Choisun Academy?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.440
I was made an offer.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.840
I was surprised too.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.669
I didn't expect...

00:15:52.809 --> 00:15:54.710
a Daechi-dong academy to want a has-been like me.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.409
The work will be much harder than you think.

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:00.179
Why?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.879
Do you think I'll send fewer students...

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.419
to university than you?

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.990
No, that's not what I meant.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.429
I regret it.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:17.200
It might have been nicer...

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.129
if I'd joined this industry sooner.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:24.139
I feel so free,

00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:29.009
and I could've enjoyed the luxury of money for longer.

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:39.919
"Parasite."

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:44.929
That's what you called us academy instructors.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960
That hurts.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.940
You looked so nonchalant then,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.139
I didn't think it hurt you.

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:02.009
That was because I thought hearing such insults...

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.850
was part of my job of improving kids' grades.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.179
I guess you must put up with that kind of hurt here.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.789
I learned something today.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:18.860
I met Choisun Academy's director, Choi Hyung Sun too.

00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:21.460
As good as the offer is,

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.900
she'll demand a great performance.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.769
If you're that concerned,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.670
will you send over some of your Chanyoung High students?

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:44.819
Yes, hello.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.059
I took the day off to be somewhere.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.400
No, you don't have to.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.140
If you insist...

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:07.140
Yes, I know the place.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
Yes.

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:14.779
Okay. I understand. Bye.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.920
The Chanyoung High students...

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.160
won't flock to my class from the start, will they?

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.970
But I want to teach them...

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.769
in my own way.

00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:41.509
What must I do to win them over?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.750
I suggested we do a free lecture.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.180
It'll be a huge affair.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.549
Discuss that with your director.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.089
Yes. I guess I should.

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:00.490
I heard...

00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:03.930
you taught many Chanyoung High students.

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:08.000
So I came to ask for advice.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:13.640
But something urgent just came up.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.829
I won't go far.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.730
(Consultation Room 2)

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.710
I hope...

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.380
we can have the meal you took a rain check on.

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:19.839
- No way. - Goodness.

00:20:19.869 --> 00:20:21.210
That's cute enough.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.579
Going up.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.779
The doors are closing.

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:28.180
What's going on?

00:20:28.819 --> 00:20:29.879
Wasn't that Mr. Pyo?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.619
- That was Korean Pyo, right? - Yes.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.420
What was he doing here?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.298
We won't schedule a test for the regular students.

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:51.439
Announce we'll split them into classes...

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.308
based on their mock exam results.

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:54.339
Okay.

00:20:58.009 --> 00:21:00.250
(Seo Hye Jin)

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.119
Send in med school class teachers Gu In Hui and Cheon Soo Yeon.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:06.588
I want to go over questions for the future 10th-graders.

00:21:06.589 --> 00:21:07.619
Okay.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.059
And schedule a dinner with Lee Sang Hyeon.

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:13.390
I'll tell him we won't extend his contract.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.460
He might refuse to join you for dinner.

00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:20.400
He seems to know his contract won't be extended.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.700
He's already scheduling special classes...

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.869
in Pyeongchon and Jukjeon.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.750
(Seo Hye Jin)

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.410
It's Seo Hye Jin.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.119
Can we meet?

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:39.390
Invite Lee Sang Hyeon to dinner just once.

00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:42.759
If he doesn't know how hard it is to eat with me,

00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:45.559
that's the extent of his perception.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.950
Why are you staring at me?

00:22:08.819 --> 00:22:09.950
Aren't you worried?

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:13.119
Not really.

00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:16.190
I think this is pretty serious.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.059
It didn't look like Ms. Seo would lose to him.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.029
Do you think this is about winning or losing?

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:26.869
He's just trying to start a childish fight.

00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:28.940
He must've wanted to get into her head,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.099
but he won't even get a tooth into Ms. Seo.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.970
Right.

00:22:35.509 --> 00:22:37.940
The friend of mine that you met. The post-grad student.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.950
He wants your number. Can I give it to him?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.750
No.

00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:44.849
Don't give it out unless it's a student or a mom.

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:47.319
Understood.

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:10.539
(Academy)

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.490
Don't be like this.

00:23:19.849 --> 00:23:20.990
You don't have to.

00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:26.529
If you quit like this, how would it make me look?

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.630
I'm sorry.

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:33.329
I lost control when I saw how many kids had gotten...

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.700
all the multiple-choice questions right.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.910
I shouldn't have talked like that to you.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.940
You suffered a lot...

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:46.549
because of me, Ms. Lee.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.049
Mr. Pyo.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:52.420
The students like you.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.890
Study hard.

00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:58.119
I hope you pass...

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:00.359
the teacher certification exam.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.559
All the senior and supervising teachers...

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.329
chewed me out.

00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:13.869
There's nothing...

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.480
I can do for you about that.

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:19.509
That's not what I'm asking.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.079
Mr. Pyo. I won't say a word about...

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.619
what you teach...

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.019
or how you teach from now on.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:35.130
Why did you...

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.799
want to become a teacher?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.839
Why are you asking me that out of the blue?

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.309
Whatever the reason,

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.509
your initial goal,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.009
determination, and intention.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.750
I hope you keep and stick to them.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.789
Mr. Pyo.

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:03.390
If you'll excuse me.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.140
The person you have reached is unavailable.

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:26.579

Why not?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.460
It's just a phone number.

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.859
Hey, did you explain...

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.829
why I wanted to see her again?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.769
I have a lot to say about how humanities is taught.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:47.970
Well, I'd say...

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.099
she's not at all interested in you.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.240
As a human, as a scholar,

00:25:54.609 --> 00:25:55.609
or as a man.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.409
I'm busy.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.910
I have a class soon. Let's talk later.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.578
And text in advance if you want to sleep over.

00:26:03.579 --> 00:26:04.980
Or I'll change the passcode.

Kim. What are you doing here?

00:26:21.569 --> 00:26:23.400
I applied to take some time off.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.099
The professor asked to see me.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.210
Are you joining the army?

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.109
- No. - Then what?

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.509
I'll retake the KSAT.

00:26:34.109 --> 00:26:35.150
To go to med school?

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.220
Good for you.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.190
- How about a coffee? - Sounds good.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.230
Are you in shock?

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:50.460
Yes, a bit.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.970
I'm more amused and excited.

00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:01.609
What should we plan this time? My heart's pounding.

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:05.008
He doesn't look like much of a striker,

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:06.650
but I don't let my guard down.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880
What did you say?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.990
That teacher.

he's their hidden card,

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:18.190
but he's no big deal.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:21.430
Do you not know?

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.529
Know what?

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.329
Well...

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:31.200
There was an issue in the last mid-term.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:35.240
You went to the school and demanded another exam.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.210
You knew.

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:40.079
Our counselor told me.

00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:42.880
And I thought you did what you would do.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.390
Did you hear the full story?

00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:47.619
And you're still saying that?

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.429
He quit his job as a teacher because of that.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.529
Well...

00:27:54.589 --> 00:27:57.328
I get the feeling there's no direct correlation,

00:27:57.329 --> 00:27:59.400
but even if there were,

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:03.039
shouldn't that Pyo guy be bowing to you with thanks?

00:28:04.569 --> 00:28:06.839
He looked old enough to have at least 20 years experience.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.309
Do you think it's easy to get such an offer at his age?

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:12.750
He had his own belief and philosophy.

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:15.579
He had pride in the fact he chose...

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.319
his career in high school.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.059
I'd wanted to ask this when I started here.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.929
Why are you so determined to devalue your own job?

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.068
No, I'm not devaluing my job.

00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:36.369
Kids who give up.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.808
The first thing they give up on...

00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:40.369
are their school classes.

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:45.109
What do you think schoolteachers teach...

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.109
that makes them so special while you talk...

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.819
as if we have no value at all?

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:52.989
He taught in schools for a long time.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.250
And he's that much older.

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:56.160
How could he survive in an academy?

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.690
Are you devaluing schools?

00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:01.659
As a place you can survive at...

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.900
if you just have a belief?

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:08.368
The point isn't where you teach.

00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:10.740
Isn't it who sends more kids to better universities?

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.069
That's enough.

00:29:13.109 --> 00:29:14.170
Ms. Seo.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.278
Don't pile on the guilt that you don't deserve...

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:18.779
and relax and teach.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.420
Come to my place after work.

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:26.049
No. We're not on the same page.

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:36.259
What?

00:29:38.259 --> 00:29:39.268
Why not?

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:42.139
Choisun Academy was always famous...

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.269
for hiring ex-schoolteachers from the area.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.339
This is an unusual case.

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:53.109
Ms. Choi took a slight peek.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.318
She said he was nicely dressed...

00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:58.480
and looked pretty normal.

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:00.919
But I don't think the students...

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.859
will go for a teacher like him.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.829
He's an older man which is what students...

00:30:06.089 --> 00:30:08.160
and parents like the least.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.430
And he caused...

00:30:10.431 --> 00:30:13.269
quite an issue at Chanyoung High.

00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:17.969
The White Haired Witch...

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.869
wouldn't make such a move unless she weighed things out.

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:31.920
(Daechi Chase)

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:04.150
Ms. Yeon Joo, hi.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.420
It's been a while. Have you been well?

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:09.759
Me? My days are pretty much the same.

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:12.190
Is your child growing up well?

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.699
Cooing over your child is one thing, but you should get back to work...

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.859
before you lose your touch.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.799
Right. Well,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.299
it's no big deal,

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.710
but can you get me someone's phone number...

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:28.940
and keep it between us?

00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:28.729
The mother's back is part of her body...

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.400
which is why honorifics were used indirectly.

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.740
That concludes today's class.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.450
The empty seats bring us back to reality, doesn't it?

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:42.549
Let's applaud ourselves for the good work we did.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.319
I hope many of you enrolled in my special lecture for the vacation.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.589
- Yes. - Yes.

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:52.859
Also, who here will take additional classes...

00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:54.859
in classical poetry?

00:32:57.829 --> 00:32:59.470
Check out Ms. Nam Cheong Mi's class.

00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:01.630
Who's Nam Cheong Mi?

00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:04.399
The new instructor here. I heard the rumors.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.869
I bet you haven't heard her...

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.970
recite "Song of the Northeast" as a rap.

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.579
Teach me how it goes after learning it.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.779
- Sure. - Sure.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.778
Right. Enjoy the last day of the semester,

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:16.150
and I'll see you at my vacation lecture.

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:19.089
Ms. Seo, Pyo Sang Seob...

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.119
Is Mr. Pyo going to teach here?

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.519
No.

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:26.559
But I saw him earlier at the academy.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.430
That was for something else. Why do you ask?

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.269
His classes are actually nice.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.400
He's not as humorous as you are,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.569
but I liked his after-school classes.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.309
- What? - Right?

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.740
Yes.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.140
Ha Yul even filled in the reading notes.

00:33:44.309 --> 00:33:45.410
Stop it.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.809
Gosh. You're making me jealous.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.650
Don't be. You're the one we love.

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:11.140
(Samseong-ro)

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.949
Where are you? I'm waiting at the subway station.

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:31.489
I don't want to meet up today, so head home.

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:34.389
What... You can't just cancel on me.

00:34:34.789 --> 00:34:36.800
If there's a difference of opinion, we should talk it out.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.559
Through a healthy discussion...

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:40.070
Hello?

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.468
- What now? - Keep taking my call like that,

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.940
and I'll show up at your house.

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:50.880
Where are you?

00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:55.710
I'm on my way home.

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:57.579
I thought about it.

00:34:58.119 --> 00:34:59.919
If you can't get me her phone number,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.119
setting up...

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.619
a casual get-together like last time is also an option.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.530
I have something to say to her, that's all.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.400
What the...

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.730
Wait.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.679
Shouldn't this usually happen between a man and a woman?

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:25.710
Don't get me started.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.500
- Would you like to join me? - Really?

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:50.170
- Are you buying? - Of course.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:52.610
Sounds like fun.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.389
It's Seo Hye Jin.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.289
I'm outside the academy. Can we talk for a bit?

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.829
Please.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.309
(Daechi Choisun Academy)

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.149
Thanks for the great meal.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.679
- Sure. Have a good one. - You too.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.289
Wait.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.960
What brings you to this place?

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:46.329
I was hungry after class, so I grabbed a bowl of noodles.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.659
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.530
What about Ms. Seo?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.099
Didn't you two get off work together?

00:36:53.269 --> 00:36:55.469
It just happened this way.

00:36:57.239 --> 00:36:58.400
I see. Then...

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.869
- Enjoy your meal. - Sure.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.509
- Hi. - Hi.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.379
- Hello. - Hey. Call her back.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.849
- What? - This second!

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.010
What...

00:37:10.949 --> 00:37:12.618
(Night Flight)

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:14.820
- Ms. Nam, wait. - Yes?

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.389
If you're not too busy, have a drink with us.

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:19.328
- The bus will stop running. - Sure.

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:20.429
Then I'll...

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.659
I'll drive you home.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.500
With what car?

00:37:25.659 --> 00:37:27.400
My mom's.

00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:45.849
I was told to escort you up.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.030
So Mr. Pyo...

00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:58.760
It's Vice-director Pyo.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.340
When did you first meet with Vice-director Pyo?

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:06.869
Aren't you here to talk to the director?

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:09.210
You can ask her yourself.

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:12.340
She's not someone you can meet easily,

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.909
so I'd ask everything I could when I have the chance.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.579
Sure.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:23.119
By the way,

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:27.460
is Lee Si Woo doing well?

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.630
Yes, I guess.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.969
He's a tricky one, isn't he? He also speaks his mind.

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:40.739
I see.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:47.650
Come in.

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:58.389
Just a second.

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:31.460
I apologize,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.130
but I have a lot to handle before the school semester ends.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.360
Did I make you wait long?

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:38.329
Yes, you did.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.570
Please have a seat.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500
I also apologize to you, Mr. Park,

00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:45.940
for keeping you around this late.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.239
Since you're here though, please wait around a while longer.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.280
This won't take long.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.590
Did you have...

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.320
unfinished business with us?

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:07.630
The empty office you showed me.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.860
The vice-director's office.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.329
Can I accept the offer?

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.170
It's too bad,

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:18.699
but we found the right person for the job recently.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:23.510
That was fast. It didn't take you very long.

00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:27.150
It would've been better to have you on board,

00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:28.949
but I'm quite satisfied with our recent choice.

00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:36.389
You seem to have...

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.420
already met the man who occupies that office.

00:40:40.659 --> 00:40:43.829
It's too late into the night for silly riddles.

00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:47.329
I want to know why. Why him of all people?

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.599
That's a rude question to ask...

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.809
both me and the vice-director.

00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:54.839
What reason would I have...

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.380
other than him being a great teacher?

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.949
He should be teaching at a school.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.050
That...

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.860
That side of you is what I like about you.

00:41:12.619 --> 00:41:16.059
When your own job is at stake, you turn into a wrecker...

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:18.099
Sorry about that.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.969
You wield your sword like a true champion.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.070
But after you win your battle,

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:27.070
you go back to being righteous.

00:41:29.139 --> 00:41:32.849
Not everyone can be as brazen as that.

00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:39.179
You truly are someone I wish to work with.

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:41.119
During mid-terms...

00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:42.590
You hung Mr. Pyo...

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:45.118
at the center of the teacher's office...

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:47.260
and beat him to a pulp so to speak.

00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:50.199
In front of his colleagues, might I add.

00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:55.329
But now you say he should be teaching in school.

00:41:56.539 --> 00:42:00.039
That has to be the joke of the year for me.

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:05.110
That was out of line.

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:06.349
Was it?

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:09.919
Before opening classes for Heewon High students,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.719
you tried to mess with me with the days you chose.

00:42:12.579 --> 00:42:14.948
Then, you plastered the streets of Daechi-dong...

00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:16.860
with ads that were obviously aimed at me.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.360
But what did you say...

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:21.489
when you declined my offer to come work at this academy?

00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:24.030
What I want to say is,

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.369
the reasoning for my decision has nothing to do...

00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:29.429
with what you offered.

00:42:38.739 --> 00:42:40.679
I'll remain at my current academy.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.960
Can you tell me the real reason?

00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:56.300
I want to teach Si Woo.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.500
He's a smart student.

00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:02.969
Wouldn't he take classes here if you chose to move?

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.969
He gave up his scholarship...

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.309
and chose to study at my current academy.

00:43:08.039 --> 00:43:10.110
I couldn't possibly tell him to come back here again.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.349
If he comes back, he'll have the same scholarship deal.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.349
If that's what he wants,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.480
I'll let him...

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.750
take your class instead of mine.

00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:27.229
Moving academies might not seem like a big deal,

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.260
but to someone as young as him, the decision must've been tough.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.000
And it required courage on his part.

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:35.969
I couldn't possibly change my mind...

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.539
and shatter his decision.

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:42.979
At that moment, you sounded like the teacher...

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.610
from "Dead Poets Society."

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.309
What was his name again? Keating or Keaten?

00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:51.780
I'm asking why you offered Mr. Pyo the job.

00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:52.849
I don't deserve...

00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:55.288
your sarcasm.

00:43:55.289 --> 00:43:56.760
Don't think of it as sarcasm.

00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.360
I'll say it again,

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:01.730
but that's what I liked about you.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.159
An educator but also a businesswoman.

00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:10.098
There aren't many people like you...

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:13.369
who can blindly ignore the disjunction between the two.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.440
Mr. Pyo...

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.409
shouldn't turn into...

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.549
a wrecker like me.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.650
He's the one...

00:44:29.519 --> 00:44:31.789
who made this choice.

00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:33.960
All I did was make an offer.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.800
In that sense,

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.269
aren't I more reasonable than you are?

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.098
He's not on the younger side.

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:44.968
If he fails to prove himself, he'll be at the edge of a cliff.

00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:46.939
Are you sure you don't want him to fail...

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.010
since he might take Chanyoung High students from you?

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:51.509
I may be a wrecker, but not one that cruel.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.510
Or...

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.709
could you still be...

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.250
looking down on him since he once...

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.348
got a good beating from you in the teacher's office?

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:02.289
- Ms. Choi... - If neither is true,

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.289
there is only one thing you can do.

00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:10.800
Show support.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.559
Go, Mr. Pyo!

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.150
I appreciate you taking the time to see me.

00:45:39.219 --> 00:45:41.530
Yet, I'm still a big fan of yours.

00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:44.860
That is why I'm telling you this.

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:47.929
You should be worried about the competition.

00:45:49.369 --> 00:45:51.670
Now that Mr. Pyo has shifted gears,

00:45:51.869 --> 00:45:52.869
he will be an opponent...

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.769
that might give you a run for your money.

00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:58.440
His acumen has been verified...

00:45:59.309 --> 00:46:00.650
by me personally.

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:47.559
Unbelievable.

00:46:49.929 --> 00:46:51.030
"I don't want to meet with you today."

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.300
How could she say that?

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.500
Hey, let me be honest.

00:46:57.769 --> 00:47:00.639
I'm barely getting used to you dating our teacher,

00:47:01.409 --> 00:47:03.908
but now you want me to give you dating advice as well?

00:47:03.909 --> 00:47:04.940
Hear me out.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.308
The one whose feelings are deeper is at a disadvantage,

00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:08.780
but how could she do this to me?

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:13.590
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:16.519
Did you and Hye Jin perhaps get into an argument?

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.289
No, I just had to take it, no questions asked.

00:47:20.489 --> 00:47:23.658
What? But Hye Jin isn't the type to vent her frustration...

00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:24.900
out on people.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.730
Tell me about it. I'm frustrated because I know that.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.670
So much for the relationship being a secret.

00:47:32.239 --> 00:47:33.769
Is there anyone in Daechi-dong who doesn't know?

00:47:35.869 --> 00:47:36.880
Hang in there.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.219
What's on your mind?

00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:49.590
That a younger guy is not ideal...

00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:51.218
to date.

00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:52.619
- What? Why? - Why?

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:56.460
I wasn't like this at 29.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.559
Or maybe age isn't the issue.

00:48:00.869 --> 00:48:02.099
What...

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:06.139
What do you mean by that?

00:48:08.409 --> 00:48:09.840
Ms. Seo...

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.679
It's not that she doesn't want to see you. She probably can't.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.880
What exactly did Mr. Pyo say?

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:21.750
I didn't ask.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.320
You're a disgrace to all men who date older women.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.190
Without asking about what he said,

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:28.889
you just told her...

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:30.929
he was the competition to beat?

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.369
Was I wrong to say that?

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.138
Ms. Seo is tough and...

00:48:38.139 --> 00:48:39.469
Yes, she's tough.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.670
But even people like her hurt just as much.

00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:43.139
As if.

00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:45.139
Their offensive strategy is pretty obvious.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.849
The teacher she challenged and won against...

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.879
quit his school job of 20 years and told her...

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.519
he was entering the private sector.

00:48:54.519 --> 00:48:56.689
That was more than him declaring a simple war...

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.119
that would end in a few Chanyoung students jumping ship.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.429
Of course it was.

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:03.629
But then her favorite student...

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.730
Hold on.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.929
"Boyfriend."

00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:11.469
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

00:49:12.539 --> 00:49:14.340
I feel bad for Ms. Seo.

00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:19.179
- You're done for. - Hey!

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:21.250
What do you mean it's over for me?

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.920
You should be grateful that Seo Hye Jin is earnest.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.379
Or else, you would've been dumped.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.419
What did I say about you saying her name like that?

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.389
She has to play the role of your sweet first love...

00:49:31.659 --> 00:49:33.590
and also be the mentor who changes your life.

00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:38.199
Although she's bleeding internally,

00:49:38.429 --> 00:49:40.900
she has to cut off the enemy commander's head.

00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:43.300
What else was there?

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.340
Oh, right.

00:49:45.769 --> 00:49:47.109
When you whine,

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.440
she has to indulge in a healthy discussion with you.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.639
Unbelievable. Seo Hye Jin is a true saint.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.780
Gosh.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.519
You fool.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.190
Ms. Nam, I'm sorry, but can I take off?

00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:04.360
Yes, but get the bill.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:06.058
I'll get it, so just go.

00:50:06.059 --> 00:50:08.829
No, I should pay for today's class. Thanks.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.599
Make sure you get her home safely.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.300
Don't worry and beat it.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.469
- I'm heading out first. - I see.

00:50:22.139 --> 00:50:23.880
- I'll see you around. - Sure.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.579
- See you. - Bye.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.269
Hey, So Young.

00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:53.300
Yes. I'm going to head home now.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.510
Yes. I've been busy today.

00:50:56.739 --> 00:50:58.039
I heard you guys had a fight.

00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:02.280
How do you think I heard about that? I have my informant here.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.619
Actually, if you're not far, why don't you stop by here?

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.849
I'd love to hear about your quarrel with your boyfriend for once.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.590
Seriously. What on earth happened?

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.659
No, it's nothing serious.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.960
I just...

00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:20.929
had a small problem.

00:51:22.469 --> 00:51:23.469
Yes.

00:51:23.969 --> 00:51:25.039
So Young.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.638
I had a very long day today.

00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:31.539
Yes. Right.

00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:34.079
Let's take a rain check on our year-end party.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:37.150
And stop talking about Jun Ho.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.849
Actually, I miss him like crazy.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.789
Sure. Okay.

00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:51.460
Yes. I know that you're busy. I'll always be understanding.

00:51:51.929 --> 00:51:53.969
Okay. All right then.

00:51:54.969 --> 00:51:56.730
Drive safely. Yes.

00:51:56.869 --> 00:51:57.940
Bye.

00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:06.239
She told me she missed him like crazy.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.579
No.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.579
What? What is it?

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.849
I don't think it's a typical fight couples have.

00:52:12.519 --> 00:52:13.519
What?

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.359
- Earlier, Mr. Lee was here... - Okay.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.920
with his friend and another teacher.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.989
Well, you can drop me off in Donam-dong.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.699
Wait. Is that where you live?

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.530
I thought you lived a bit farther north.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.369
I won't have to pay a lot of money for the taxi if I catch one there.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:33.570
That area has a lot of taxis too.

00:52:35.639 --> 00:52:36.710
Gosh, don't do that.

00:52:36.909 --> 00:52:38.239
Let me drop you off in your neighborhood.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.280
It's the year-end holiday season. It'll be difficult to get a taxi.

00:52:41.949 --> 00:52:43.518
We live in a scary world these days.

00:52:43.519 --> 00:52:45.250
I can't let a stranger know where I live.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.789
- Gosh. - Goodness.

00:52:48.519 --> 00:52:50.960
You can't find a guy with whom you can feel safer than with me.

00:52:52.159 --> 00:52:54.690
I'm Jun Ho's friend, Seo Hye Jin's former student,

00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:56.730
and Kim Hyo Im's son.

00:52:58.599 --> 00:52:59.599
Gosh.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.969
Which area of study do you specialize in?

00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:11.539
Among literature, reading, grammar, and so on.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.909
I would say classical poetry.

00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:17.119
I like it because it's fun.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.820
What?

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.650
I like studying too.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.320
No way.

00:53:25.059 --> 00:53:27.159
What? Was that unexpected?

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.130
Yes.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.030
What?

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.030
I heard you majored in history...

00:53:32.031 --> 00:53:33.360
because your grades weren't good enough...

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:35.500
and joined the graduate program because you couldn't get a job.

00:53:36.429 --> 00:53:37.940
I have to say that...

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.670
so that they don't ask me questions and leave me alone.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:45.280
But studying is fun for me.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.579
If my mom hears this, she will be shocked...

00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:51.949
and ask why...

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.989
I couldn't get into a better college if I liked studying this much.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:17.599
Where are you?

00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:19.369
Your car isn't in the parking lot. I'm worried about you.

00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:23.039
I understand that you don't want to see me.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.380
But I still want to be with you.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.730
You won't even hear me breathing.

00:55:41.889 --> 00:55:43.159
Let me just stay by your side.

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:54.769
- Would you like a receipt? - No.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.440
- Thank you. - The food was great.

00:55:57.539 --> 00:55:59.679
- Thanks. - Thank you for treating us.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.780
- Thank you. - Bye.

00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:06.349
I'll clean up quickly. Just wait a little longer.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.219
Gosh. I wonder how that feels.

00:56:09.719 --> 00:56:10.760
What? What did you say?

00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:13.888
Say that you hate...

00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:15.230
- this certain side of you. - Okay.

00:56:15.429 --> 00:56:17.059
You've been living your life, overlooking that side of you.

00:56:18.159 --> 00:56:19.659
But one day, out of the blue,

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.199
you encounter that very same side...

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.800
in someone you hold dear.

00:56:25.039 --> 00:56:26.699
It just pops up as if it's always been there.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:31.079
Gosh. That...

00:56:32.739 --> 00:56:33.949
would be scary.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.880
Just watch over me.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.789
I'm scared.

00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:44.190
When was that?

00:56:44.289 --> 00:56:46.420
When did I say something was off about Jun Ho?

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.929
The day Hye Jin's event became a total bust?

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.099
Yes, that's when it was.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.900
Yes. I remember saying this that day.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.699
I said a certain aspect of Jun Ho reminded me of Hye Jin,

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.039
and this resembling aspect might be provoking Hye Jin.

00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:06.980
Hey, I just mindlessly thought that it was a sign...

00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:10.179
that they started to think of each other romantically.

00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:15.619
I guess that wasn't everything.

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:53.119
Jun Ho.

00:57:57.199 --> 00:57:59.099
What are you doing here? Why didn't you go upstairs?

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.030
Get in. There's somewhere I want to go with you.

00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:19.820
I'm sorry.

00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:23.989
I scared you by telling you how you were...

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.360
my first love and my teacher.

00:58:28.559 --> 00:58:29.659
I told you I loved you,

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.659
but I only saw the side of you I wanted to see.

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:34.599
I'm sorry.

00:58:38.039 --> 00:58:39.599
Did you get a crash course on relationships?

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:42.170
Maybe?

00:58:45.239 --> 00:58:46.239
Put on your seatbelt.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.960
I went to Choisun Academy.

00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:05.800
I understood why Choi Hyung Sun was the best in the field.

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:09.229
She summed up what kind of person I was...

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.340
and made it very clear for me to understand it.

00:59:13.869 --> 00:59:15.170
I'll never forget it.

00:59:17.539 --> 00:59:18.610
What did she say?

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:21.550
She called me a wrecker.

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:26.380
Is she crazy?

00:59:28.449 --> 00:59:30.119
Gosh. Seriously.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960
Goodness.

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:33.719
Just forget what she said about you.

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.630
She said I bulldozed over my enemy like a wrecker in a fight.

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:39.328
But once I came out on top,

00:59:39.329 --> 00:59:40.329
she said I took the moral high ground.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.730
She went over how big of a hypocrite I am...

00:59:44.739 --> 00:59:47.340
and how selfish and cunning I am.

00:59:48.409 --> 00:59:50.239
She picked me apart.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.809
I bet she tried to find the most hurtful things to say.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.979
This is my point. Why did you go there?

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.050
- That wouldn't change... - Don't talk back.

00:59:58.449 --> 00:59:59.849
I'm driving us there, so we can talk about this.

01:00:03.219 --> 01:00:04.789
I walked this path to barge into the office,

01:00:04.989 --> 01:00:06.219
acting all confident and proud.

01:00:08.659 --> 01:00:10.389
Your students' grades were on the line.

01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:12.530
I did it for my own gain.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.670
The answer is number five?

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.300
Gosh.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.699
I thought, "The schoolteacher is going to be stubborn."

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:23.570
"If so, I should make a big scene for everyone to see."

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:28.079
"It's a chance I can spread my name without spending a dime."

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.780
In the beginning, I was happy because I got to teach more classes.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.420
I vaguely sensed that something had gone wrong...

01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:40.289
when Mr. Pyo said...

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.090
he was going to base his questions only on the textbook.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.960
I thought, "He will be in a tight spot at school."

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.969
I could see that coming.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.130
But I didn't care. Why would I care?

01:00:51.099 --> 01:00:53.069
I didn't want to lose the new students I got,

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.170
so I was even more determined.

01:00:57.039 --> 01:00:58.539
- Was that the time... - Yes.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.280
That's when you insisted on joining the academy.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.178
I thought about ways to stop you from joining the academy.

01:01:04.179 --> 01:01:05.980
But I stopped because of that incident.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.788
Seriously? Who knew Mr. Pyo was doing me a favor?

01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:13.288
Gosh, don't say that.

01:01:13.289 --> 01:01:14.789
While we worked together at the academy,

01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:18.000
think about what he had to go through at school.

01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:20.969
That breaks my heart.

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:38.280
But what are we doing here?

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:41.549
Walking this path might help me understand,

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.119
even if it was only a fraction of what he went through.

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.129
Like how heavy his heart must have been every morning...

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.460
as he walked up this path...

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.329
and how difficult it must have been to cross that gate.

01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:57.199
Do you think I'm overreacting?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.440
A bit.

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:05.280
The White Haired Witch is the one with the evilest intention.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.980
That's what I wanted to think too.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:09.980
When I realized what I was doing, I was in front of Choisun Academy.

01:02:12.449 --> 01:02:14.619
"You're responsible for making Mr. Pyo quit his job."

01:02:17.389 --> 01:02:18.719
I guess I wanted to criticize her.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:23.059
But in the end, it backfired.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400
And?

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.510
I want to turn back time.

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.079
That's impossible.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980
I know.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.619
But shouldn't I at least give back what I gained from Mr. Pyo?

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.989
That's also impossible.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.659
Are you telling me you want to split your students?

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:57.828
If you do anything that negatively affects the academy,

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:00.199
the director and vice-director won't let that slide this time.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.739
Remember what you had to face because our free lecture was a bust.

01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:15.380
Let's go to my house.

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:20.179
I have self-restraint too. I won't make a move on you.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.119
Please understand that...

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.460
I don't want to leave you all alone after what happened today.

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.139
Gosh. They're all too big for you.

01:03:40.969 --> 01:03:41.969
Let's see.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.050
Does listening to this kind of sound help you fall asleep?

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.079
Yes, according to other people.

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:03.550
But I sleep just fine every night without stuff like this.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.960
I can't remember the last time I went to the beach.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.210
This is nice.

Is the passcode to your house different from our home passcode?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.989
What do you mean?

Where?

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.159
Not there.

01:08:31.699 --> 01:08:32.959
It's cold. You might catch a cold.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.960
- No. - Where then?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Over there.

Be careful.

Stay here for a bit.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.488
Here. I'm really sorry.

01:09:01.489 --> 01:09:02.760
What are you doing?

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.630
Mom! Let me put on some clothes. Wait.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.909
Hey, Mom.

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:20.840
- Hey. - Gosh. Give me that.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.920

How could you break your mother's heart like this?

Why are you upset?

I'll focus on my job.

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:10.890
I hope I didn't disappoint you.

Our purposes may be different,

but we may have the same goal.

You're not playing fair.

01:10:20.069 --> 01:10:21.310
I want to date, though.

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:22.809
Why don't we date?

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:24.239
I'll make the study materials again.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.640
It's the same as getting rid of everything all at once.

01:10:26.909 --> 01:10:27.909
