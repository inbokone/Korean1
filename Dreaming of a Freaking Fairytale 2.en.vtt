00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.599
(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:08.758
All fairy-tale princes are...

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.519
rich, handsome, and kind...

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.239
as if they're clones.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.039
They're all similar.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.959
But the truth is, not everyone from a wealthy family...

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.280
is cheerful and kind.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.199
Mirror. Mirror on the wall.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.280
Who is the most dashing of them all?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.480
Your Highness the Prince, of course.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:35.920
If it turns out that you're lying,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.119
I will break all the mirrors!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.279
Here's a freakishly quirky prince...

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320
who's an eighth-generation member of a super wealthy family.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.560
The romance of a Gen Z-er and an eighth-generation rich heir.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.960
It begins now.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.240
I'm suing you.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560
For attempted murder.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.200
"Attempted murder?" What do you mean?

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.319
Gosh.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.439
What is this?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.040
You're after my money, aren't you?

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.518
What? I don't even know how much money you have.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:31.799
It can't even be measured.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.799
My money is accumulating interest even as we speak now.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.359
So, just ask for money instead of trying to trick me like this.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.839
What? Why should I?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.959
Death is what I'm most afraid of.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.359
I can't have fun once I die. There are so many fun things I can do.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.319
This guy is crazy. I shouldn't get involved.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.840
All right. I'm really sorry, but it was an accident.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.518
Please hand over my shoe first.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.518
What? This is evidence. I can't hand it over.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.039
Why do you need evidence?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.679
I told you. It wasn't intentional.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680
I don't believe you.

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.399
The shoe suddenly slipped off and fell right on my head?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.959
How could such a coincidence happen, unless it was intentional?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.399
It was totally intentional.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.719
When stuff like that happens, people say, "This is not my day."

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.878
What about when a bird poops on you?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.530
Does the bird do that to get back at you?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.960
You see, I'm not that unlucky.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.000
I am a lucky man.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.680
You're obnoxious.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.370
I said it wasn't intentional. What is with you?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.599
Give it back.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.810
"Obnoxious?"

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.879
Why don't you go ahead and drop the honorifics too?

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.240
Shall I?

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.199
Then let me go now, will you?

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.089
No, not a chance.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.439
I can't be lenient with stuff like this.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.370
No mercy.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.439
If you keep this up, there will be real problems.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.530
For me? Or for you?

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.810
For both of us.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.158
My life has been a roller coaster ride, so if you mess with me,

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.759
you'll face a tumultuous future too.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.199
Shall I show you how messed up your life can be?

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.840
This is "intentional."

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.080
And this is acting with good intentions.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.439
I saved you.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.800
Just like the hour hand and the minute hand meet at noon,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.039
two strangers have met,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.719
and a new kind of magic is starting.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.360
My gosh.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.400
How dare he try to steal my shoe right before my job interview?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.560
Anyway, Shin Jae Rim.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.599
From now on, try to have some mercy on rich jerks.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960
Relax.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.800
I am an Angel Manager.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.319
I must smile from this moment on.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.599
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.719
My gosh.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.120
Who walked into my office just now?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.839
I thought you were the devil without the wings.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.480
(Resume, Shin Jae Rim)

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.959
So, you're here for an interview.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.079
I'm sorry. Only nice people can be our Angels.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.730
Their job is to connect people together.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.610
If mean people do the job, we'll go out of business.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.519
What?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
What is this?

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.319
How come you're all quiet now?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.920
You were well-spoken earlier.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.480
I'll give you one last chance to say what you want.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.759
Is it nice...

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.240
to be able to talk like this as the hiring party?

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.680
Yes, it's the best.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.319
It gives me a thrill.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.519
Then...

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.240
What if I pray?

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.800
You said you were afraid of death.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.399
You'll live a short but eventful life,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.759
so I pray that you can never buy happiness...

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.000
with your immeasurable amount of money.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.959
You see, I desperately wanted this job.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.720
It's not fair that you get to live a happy life when I can't.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.800
Then what do you want to do?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.999
I hope you get...

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.360
struck by lightning, from top to bottom!

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.439
In moments of crisis,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.000
animals discover abilities they didn't know they had.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.879
A zebra can throw a back kick at a wild beast,

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.920
and a piglet can roar at a lion.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.000
In this moment of crisis, Jae Rim...

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.240
verbally attacked him with her unbending confidence.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.839
By the way, what's with that umbrella?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.600
Is he emotionally attached to it or something?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.479
He's paranoid that he might get stabbed in the back.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.599
So, he uses the umbrella to always protect himself.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.160
That cannot act as a shield.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.879
Who knows? He could be hiding a weapon in that umbrella.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.439
Can you believe that a CEO could be that young?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.519
Someone's young and rich,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.600
while I'm young and poor.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.680
A young guy who's rich is the odd one.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.560
It's so unfair.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.040
You should shine most brightly when you're young.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.480
But some of us have to feel like pathetic losers because we're poor.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.279
A good person who works hard...

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.759
suddenly falls in love as if it's her fate.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.519
Then she finds out that the man she loves is wealthy.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.399
Will things like that never happen in our lives?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.398
Try analysing the big data of our lives.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.040
Of course, it'll never happen!

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.800
People like us have to be doggedly persistent in finding ways...

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.959
to earn a living.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.959
Gosh, seriously. What an obnoxious jerk.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.680
The universe is so unfair.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.480
A jerk like him...

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.759
deserves to get struck by lightning,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.560
big-time.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.318
I hope you get...

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:02.160
struck by lightning, from top to bottom!

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.399
Gosh, I'm still traumatized by it.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.519
I saved you.

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:45.840
Hey, have you finally lost your mind?

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.480
What's with you?

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.399
Well, I met a woman.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.679
She was so weird.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.210
Hey, don't tell me she slapped you in the face.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.090
My ears did hurt.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.960
The moment wealthy heirs like us get slapped in the face,

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.450
it's declared a KO.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
A KO? Me?

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:07.919
As if.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.759
What? A KO?

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.450
There's no way I'll fall for that woman.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.090
Peekaboo.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:24.679
What are you up to?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.759
No.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:46.840
Go away. Go!

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.279
They said to think of women as lifeless stones.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.559
Yes, she's just a stone.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.450
She's a stone.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.039
All right.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:10.799
One.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.000
Two.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.210
What kind of stone? A stone named Jae Rim?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.039
This is nuts, seriously!

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.519
I must be losing my mind.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:54.090
Why do I keep seeing her? Darn it.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.039
Seriously, this is driving me crazy.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.480
Darn, what the...

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.240
Seriously!

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.399
Gosh.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120
(Resume, Shin Jae Rim)

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.080
She's nothing special.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.200
What has she done to me?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320
Could it be...

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960
Did she hypnotize me?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.080
(Milk, Original)

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.959
Cold brew.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.960
Turn into a delicious latte.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.039
Abracadabra!

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720
This is magic.

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.480
Oh, it's good.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.359
(You have missed 5 payments for your health insurance.)

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.878
I'll die while trying to make my insurance payments.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:40.840
(Your credit card bill payment will be taken out of your account.)

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.600
(Your student loan interest payment is due on November 20.)

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.960
They're taking all my money when I only make peanuts.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.638
(I'm Shin Jae Rim. I'm hard-working and optimistic.)

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.840
(I will put every effort into fulfilling my duties.)

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:55.559
(Incoming Call)

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.599
Hello? Who's this?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.039
I'm Moon Cha Min, the CEO of Chungdam Heaven.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.359
Why call so early and ruin my pleasant morning?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.519
I wanted to call you as soon as possible...

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200
to Chungdam Heaven.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.559
You're not done yet?

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.679
I told you it was a mistake and apologized.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.039
Are you a pervert who enjoys being cursed at?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.600
Shall I do a little warm up, then?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.200
Yes, go for it.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.320
Do it in front of me while staring me in the face.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:33.959
I don't even want to cross paths with you again.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960
Oh, really?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.039
Gosh, that's such a shame.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:39.679
I called to let you know that you got the job at Chungdam Heaven.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.879
Pardon me?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.720
What are you thinking?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.679
Are you hiring me to abuse me?

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.960
If I do that, you'll put another curse on me.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.678
I thought you were the evil Royal Noble Consort Hui.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.919
Why did you decide to hire me if you thought I was that evil?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.720
Royal Noble Consort Hui is charming.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.879
You're funny.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120
My goodness.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.679
"Who'd want to work with such a psycho?"

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.519
You're probably expecting to hear something like that,

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:04.320
but I should do it.

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:06.879
They say,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.600
"You need a villain to take down another villain..."

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:10.199
"and a lunatic..."

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.080
"to handle another lunatic."

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.200
You really are unpredictable.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.158
You'll see me today at Chungdam Heaven.

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:19.240
All right. Hurry up and meet me here.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.399
I'll put up with you.

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:24.039
Does it mean today is our first day?

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.719
Please make sure I get paid for every hour I work.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.120
I refuse to work for free, even if it's just for a minute.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
See you later.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.519
Dad.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:48.159
Dad!

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:56.919
Oh, my.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.240
I'm quite handsome.

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:01.639
My, look at that jawline.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.879
It's as sharp as a blade.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.720
Do I have to be this dressed up...

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.200
to see her?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720
Oh, right.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.679
Women hate gold chains like this.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840
Hey, you.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720
Goodness.

00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:28.080
Women hate men who wear tight pants.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.080
Gosh, this is crazy. I can even pull this off.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600
No.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.480
I should be humble.

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.720
Gosh, the fur is flying everywhere.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.559
I suffer from chronic rhinitis.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:00.440
Yes, this is what a real man wears when he goes to war.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.600
I'm not doing this to impress her.

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.799
But what if she falls for me?

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:12.039
Then things will get complicated.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.960
Now, it's perfect.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.159
I think she'll hate me.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:31.240
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:16:40.159 --> 00:16:41.759
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.200
Hello.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.720
My gosh. So you can be polite and can behave sensibly at times.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.519
Yes, when I need to earn money.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.839
So, money can make you behave better.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.720
Yes, I love money.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.200
The more I get paid, the nicer I become.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.479
I wasn't really expecting you to be nice.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.359
I've lived long enough to know that money is a scary thing.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.320
So I will obediently follow the capitalist system.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:03.200
Okay, so? What do you need me to do?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.720
- Put on a friendly smile? - Such a capitalist smile?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200
No, thank you.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.650
If there are things you want to say, let it all out without a filter.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.039
That's what I like.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.170
Oh, I see.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.920
Can I be really honest?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.890
Yes, go for it.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.920
Is that a chastity belt?

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:30.559
What?

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:33.650
How could this look like a chastity belt?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.838
The design looks a little different, but it does the same thing.

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:39.650
Not a single woman would come and talk to you when you're wearing it,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.920
so we can call it a chastity belt.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.890
My, looking nice!

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.720
What? "Looking nice?"

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.599
What is wrong with this?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.000
Darn it!

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:55.799
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960
Attention, please.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:04.410
I was wondering what I should do to have some fun today...

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.559
and decided to hire a talented newbie.

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.518
- Applause, please. - Nice!

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:10.650
Hello, everyone.

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:12.410
She's new.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:13.960
So, what should we do?

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.359
The initiation ceremony must be done.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.519
I am Ground, introduce yourself

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.199
Is this a camera prank?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.559
After one beat

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.079
No, we're doing it for real. Tell us your dream to introduce yourself.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.239
After two beats

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.409
This isn't some kids' club. Why should adults do this?

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.519
Goodness. Just do it.

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:50.440
After 3 beats, 1, 2, 3, 4

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.279
Eternal youth!

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.079
Crypto jackpot!

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240
Anti-ageing!

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.720
A young husband!

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.240
Lease maturity!

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.240
Cinderella!

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.519
This goes to show the importance...

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.359
of what you think about often.

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:24.518
Your hidden desires can reveal themselves all of a sudden,

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:27.410
and they're bound to cause trouble.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.359
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.440
I thought she was interesting.

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:42.960
Turns out, she's just like any other woman.

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:55.758
Hey, your predecessor became Cinderella and left.

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:58.239
How could you say right off the bat that you wanted to be Cinderella?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.720
I was suddenly asked to state what my dream was,

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:03.169
so I said it without thinking.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.200
My gosh.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.480
So, that really is your dream.

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:08.170
My goodness.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.839
I had no idea.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.920
You had me fooled.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200
What do you mean?

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.599
I never fooled you.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.799
So, you weren't desperate for a job. You desperately want to get married.

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:30.319
That's right.

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:32.799
I wanted to work hard...

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.170
and find a good man to marry. That's why I joined Chungdam Heaven.

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.170
A person like that is called an opportunist. Am I wrong?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.200
I hate people like that.

00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:42.319
I really can't stand them.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.119
I am not an opportunist.

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:46.240
I'm just tired of my reality. That's all.

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:47.960
I see. Life has been hard for you.

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.759
But even so, I'm not a philanthropist.

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:53.889
I can't work with you because you have too many issues.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.410
I told you I'd never work for you for free. Not even for a minute.

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:59.720
We said today would be my first day.

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:01.519
Day One!

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:03.119
Then let's do this.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.680
Let's make a bet.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.440
Let fate decide whether or not you will work here.

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:12.519
I believe that having fun is the most important thing in life.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.680
Follow your joy.

00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:18.359
That's nice.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.558
Then how about us two nut heads...

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:22.440
have a real showdown, without our job titles involved?

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.960
Sure, sounds good. You may decide what our showdown will entail.

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:27.440
Oh, great.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.960
Follow me.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.039
They look like they're about to cause trouble.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.799
A man and a woman causing trouble?

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.920
That kind of trouble...

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.118
begins when sparks are ignited...

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:57.119
once their eyes meet.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.799
(Employment Contract)

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.079
(Employment Contract)

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:11.599
Let's see who can drink more.

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:13.640
Okay, sounds good.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.920
But why here?

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:17.920
I know it's a showdown, but the taste matters.

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:19.519
Does it taste better by the Han River?

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.119
I mean, it's the same product.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.598
Everything tastes better by the Han River.

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:26.759
That includes ramyeon and fried chicken with beer.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.799
It's one of the privileges of living in Seoul!

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.079
But are you sure you'll be all right?

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.758
You'd better not change your mind later.

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:36.119
Why? You don't think you can do it?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720
Are you backing out again?

00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:40.440
Of course not.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.880
Do you know how healthy my organs are?

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.119
I've been taking great care of my organs by only eating organic food.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:48.279
The moment alcohol enters my bloodstream,

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:50.880
they'll start breaking it down and push it out of my system right away.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.159
My diet mainly consists of junk such as palm oil,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
high-fructose corn syrup, and GMO foods.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.719
Maybe that's why my organs are incredibly strong.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.240
Alcohol does nothing for me.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:03.160
For me, alcohol is like a health supplement.

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:06.758
It's really good for improving blood circulation.

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:09.359
(Heavy drinking has a detrimental effect on your health.)

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:12.839
You're talking nonsense again.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.480
You see, I don't go easy on women.

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:16.799
You can't ask me for help.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:19.039
And I won't go easy on you because you're a guy.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.680
You don't even know what kind of family I'm from.

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:37.240
Oh, yes!

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.399
- When are you off until? - Until today.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.559
Nice, this is great.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.359
Hey, let's gulp these down.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.759
Sounds like a plan. Let's quench our thirst.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.319
I was always so bored at home.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.839
Mom's pregnant,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.359
and Jae Rim is a lightweight.

00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:52.960
She's still a baby, you know.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:54.640
A baby, my foot.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.759
She's too brave for her own good.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720
Oh, boy.

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:04.039
All right. Talking nonstop won't get you anywhere.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.920
Let's get started right away.

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:15.759
What? You can't even open it?

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:19.599
It's slippery because it's wet.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.118
I have a strong grip.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:22.119
Oh, is that so?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.720
If we have an arm-wrestling match,

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:27.759
I'll beat a weakling like you right away.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:29.720
What? "A weakling?"

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:32.640
Then shall we do it?

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:34.599
Just to see who wins.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.039
Sure, let's do it.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.039
Fight fair and square.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.359
Okay, bring it on.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920
Get ready.

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:48.839
- Set, go! - Go!

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.200
- Gosh... - "Fair and square."

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.319
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:15.359
You are quite strong indeed, but I'm stronger than you.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:22.160
Oh, no!

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:24.119
I must've pressed too hard.

00:25:24.599 --> 00:25:25.880
Your nail got all messed up.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.880
No, it wasn't you. It was already like this.

00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:32.599
I see. Gosh, it scared me for a moment.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.119
Anyway, it must've hurt.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.400
Forget it. Hurry up and drink.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.079
I hope you do better this time.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.599
This time, I'm really confident that I'll win.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:01.000
Let's do it before it loses the fizz.

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:13.160
Hey.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880
This is just in.

00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:37.880
A human black hole has appeared by the Han River.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:39.640
Be careful and stay safe.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.960
(Caution, Wild Animal Zone)

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:56.039
Stop drinking. Stop!

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:22.720
Done.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.919
What are you, a whale?

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.960
It shows you how strong I am, mentally.

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:51.440
So? What do you want to do?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640
How about another glass?

00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.200
You call this a glass?

00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:57.920
Forget it. You're doggedly determined to win.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.200
Let's just say you won.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960
Really?

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.599
Then you have to guarantee that I'll get a permanent position.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.160
And you can't fire me for no reason.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.319
Yes, of course. I must keep the promise I made.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.440
What's gotten into you?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.038
Are you drunk?

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.079
No, I am not drunk.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.960
Hand over the contract.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.160
You can't annul it, saying you signed it drunk.

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.279
He'll sign it so easily?

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:29.039
Just as I expected,

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:30.960
it's fun to play with you.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.759
Think about how much fun you can have if you see me every day.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.200
All right.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.518
I'll bother you every single day. You'd better be prepared for it.

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:45.038
My gosh. I'll happily get picked on as long as you're paying me.

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.519
Anytime. Thank you.

00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:51.480
(Employer: CEO of Chungdam Heaven, Moon Cha Min)

00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.440
You're quite naive. Your dream is to become like Cinderella?

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.400
You were joking, right?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.240
I wish.

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:07.079
It is my life goal.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.440
Goodness. If I were you, I'd read the room and lie.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.599
I am aware that it goes against the modern thinking.

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:19.759
However, getting married...

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:22.039
is the only way I can get out of my situation.

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:23.799
Really?

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:26.759
Then what do you want to do once you get married?

00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:30.400
I'll live a happy life while giving and receiving love.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.920
I don't believe in such abstract ideals.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.279
It makes you the perfect target for scammers.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440
My goodness.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.960
I guess you've never been in love.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:41.440
I feel so sorry for you.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.160
I believe that every living being has the right to be loved.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.079
The innate right to be loved.

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:53.559
"The right to be loved?"

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:58.160
But not many people exercise the right to the fullest.

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.119
I love myself.

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:02.160
I'm exercising the right on myself.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.279
So I don't feel the need to date or get married.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.440
I already received plenty of love.

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.079
Good for you.

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:15.160
But aren't you lonely and bored?

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:20.920
I suppose that's why I'm here with you now.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.720
Romance is such a peculiar thing.

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:29.319
You never know who will suddenly steal your heart.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.959
It's as if there are...

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.519
invisible compatibility codes the universe has laid out.

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:37.440
Come here. Come closer for a moment.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.920
It's a match.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.480
No. Code mismatch!

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.799
Anyway, what's taking Mr. Moon so long?

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.759
Then I'll officially start tomorrow.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.240
How dare you. Your boss hasn't finished his drink.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.039
Having a conversation like this and this atmosphere.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.240
I don't mind this.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.960
The Han River is really nice.

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:18.160
Shoot. I really have to go to the restroom.

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:21.279
But this boss jerk won't leave.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.319
- Let me steal a sip. - Hey.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:35.160
We have no more booze left.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.839
All right, then. Shall we get going?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.720
My goodness.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.519
Oh, no!

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
What is it?

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.799
You said to get going. Why are you standing there?

00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:57.720
- I really have to... - What?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720
The restroom.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.680
I need to go to the restroom.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.759
Hey. You're an adult, not a child!

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.680
Gosh, she did drink a lot.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.759
Is there a restroom nearby?

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.079
No.

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:14.119
The closest one is a long walk away.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.239
(Route 1, Route 2)

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.838
(Very far)

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:23.480
(Extremely far)

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.400
Why are you so reckless?

00:32:26.599 --> 00:32:28.118
You should've considered the outcome...

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.439
and picked a spot near the restroom.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.318
So why did you have to talk so much?

00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:32.599
You talked a lot too!

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.440
Oh, no. I really have to go. My gosh.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720
Oh, no. What do I do?

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.559
Darn it.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960
What are you doing?

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640
Are you crying?

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.279
Did you pee your pants?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.799
I'm trying to squeeze out some tears.

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.359
Tears are made of water too, you know.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.039
Hey, that makes no sense!

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:04.720
Shall I stand guard for you? Do you want to go into the woods?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.960
No!

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:08.519
I am an upstanding citizen.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:11.640
The sky is watching me. I'd rather jump into the river.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.720
Do you want to borrow this to cover yourself with it?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.160
Gosh, please leave.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.239
Whether I relieve myself here or not, I'll figure it out.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.039
So please just leave.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.000
How could I walk away from someone who's clearly in a crisis?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.079
It'll be easier without you around unless you'll do it on my behalf,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.640
so please just leave!

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.519
Let me...

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.720
Just go!

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.719
Well, then... Clean this up before you leave.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360
The sky is clear, and so is my mind.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.920
I wish it was raining.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.079
I wish I was losing my mind.

00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:36.639
Hold tight.

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:39.480
I'll do the same.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.960
Could this mean we're compatible?

00:35:08.769 --> 00:35:11.400
Keep holding. If you pee on me, I will kill you.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.400
Honey, go faster.

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:15.769
You're talking nonsense now.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.480
Stay with me!

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.119
Where is it? Darn it.

00:35:20.769 --> 00:35:22.840
Cha Min, the arrogant prince,

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:27.639
has turned into a loyal, strong servant.

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.289
Very nice.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.439
Jae Rim's urethral sphincter, hang in there!

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.289
(Toilet)

00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:42.039
(Toilet)

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:46.159
Now, it's all on you.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:49.599
Thank you. I'll stay strong until the very end.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.400
(Toilet)

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400
My gosh.

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.289
Why is he still here?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.289
How am I going to face him again after this?

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.360
He's actually pretty cool.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.639
But there's nothing cool...

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.329
about this situation or what I did.

00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:29.960
It's just him.

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:36.599
Perhaps, he's a nice person.

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:42.199
Goodness.

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:48.159
Hey, stop.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480
What's with you? Why are you walking like that?

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.960
I'm embarrassed. That's why.

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:56.329
I made a complete fool of myself...

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.840
in front of you, who is my boss now,

00:37:59.239 --> 00:38:01.000
so I'm really embarrassed.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.329
Right.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.960
I don't know who the real winner is.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.639
Me, because I got a paying job out of this.

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.679
Honey!

00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:26.440
Hey, Dan A.

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:37.329
You weren't at Chungdam Heaven, and you didn't answer my calls.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.078
To find my fiancé,

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:41.769
I even had to use the couple tracking app.

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:46.519
"Fiancé?"

00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:53.159
"Honey?"

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.118
He said he didn't feel the need to date or get married,

00:38:58.119 --> 00:38:59.440
but he's engaged?

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:02.960
What is this? Why did he lie to me?

00:39:04.159 --> 00:39:05.289
Is he a bad guy?

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:12.719
You struggle and work hard to get a job...

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:15.679
only to encounter a terrible boss.

00:39:16.199 --> 00:39:20.159
I'm rooting for all job seekers and employees in the country.

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:22.809
See you next time!
