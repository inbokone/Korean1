00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,438
The deity of love is like a four-year-old child,

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,679
which means he is very unpredictable.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,159
That's why we have no way of knowing who will meet whom...

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,039
and how we will fall in love.

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,960
Cupid always does whatever he wants,

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,079
but there's one good thing about him.

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,399
"Hey, you deserve to be loved too."

9
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,849
All right. The uncontrollable Cupid.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,919
Go ahead and bring it on!

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,359
(Episode 3: Rolling Fxxking Cupid)

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,399
I see. He's your honey.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
I'll be off, then.

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,520
Hey.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,840
I came all the way here because of you, honey.

16
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,959
Right, you didn't have to come all the way here.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,280
This is exhausting for both of us.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,280
"Exhausting?"

19
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,688
I know we got engaged for strategic purposes,

20
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,239
but you still have to do your duty.

21
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,119
Can't you pick up right away when I call you?

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,318
Why should I? I'm not your personal firefighter or something.

23
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,409
Hey! You little...

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,718
We said we'd be engaged for life...

25
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,679
to stay unmarried and enjoy our freedom and being single,

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,318
so do your duty, jerk.

27
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,519
Why is this my duty?

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,719
You call this freedom?

29
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,319
You keep getting worse by the day.

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,279
If you start seeing another woman...

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,559
and call off our engagement, it'll spark an all-out war.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,959
This isn't just about the company.

33
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,000
My graceful public image.

34
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,640
What will you do if it gets tainted?

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,959
I must take care of all foreseeable problems before they take hold.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
If you get married with that temper of yours,

37
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,640
you really will have big problems.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,560
I've been taking pre-wedding cooking classes for the past five years.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,879
I can julienne onions with my eyes closed.

41
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,959
If you do not answer my call once more,

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,959
I will stick a spoon in your skull as if I'm scooping out...

43
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,560
an avocado pit.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,319
He talked as though he had no interest in getting married.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,280
But he's engaged?

46
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,090
What a weirdo.

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,840
Seriously, what is his deal?

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Who is this man?

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,599
I was just talking to myself. Go back to sleep.

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,639
I thought you wanted me to hear it.

51
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,090
Men can put on a total act to seduce a woman.

52
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,158
Why would he seduce me?

53
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,599
Gosh, just go back to sleep.

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,639
You never know, dummy.

55
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,599
Some men have weird tastes in women.

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,680
Hey, don't be naive.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,919
"Naive?"

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,479
I know so much.

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,638
You have no idea...

60
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,319
how big and vast this world is.

61
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,639
What do you know?

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,439
He has such a firm body.

63
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,360
He must work out a lot.

64
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,800
It won't even go in.

65
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,199
Gosh, it's hot.

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,080
I need to sleep.

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Honey.

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,159
Go faster.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,919
Honey, go faster.

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
Honey.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,039
Go faster.

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Our Prince Cha Min is a healthy man full of vigour,

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,319
after all.

74
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,560
How did you get the job all of a sudden?

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
You said the CEO was crazy.

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,959
I have no idea. He said I was fun.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Do I actually have a great sense of humour?

78
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,480
If you were actually funny, you'd be a comedienne now.

79
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,639
That's true.

80
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,759
I would've been a pretty comedienne.

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,919
You've got to be kidding me.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,239
With that face and your sense of humour, you'll never make it big.

83
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,730
That industry is fiercely competitive too.

84
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,610
I guess he experienced culture shock when he met you.

85
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,730
He's a prince, you know.

86
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,398
I want to make money and become a member of Chungdam Heaven...

87
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,120
so I can experience culture shock too.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
What about that job you started? You can't make money with it?

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,759
"The Unthinkable Affair With Tom Black."

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,518
I did a killer job with that recording.

91
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,439
I reached a new octave while moaning.

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,079
I sound incredibly sexy in that recording,

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,049
but it hasn't been lucrative.

94
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,730
My gosh. That is unthinkable, indeed.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,050
Can you please watch my audiobook clip?

96
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,359
If it gets more views, it'll appear under "Recommended Videos."

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,879
It's not my cup of tea.

98
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,879
Well, I can press the "like" button for you.

99
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,399
Take a listen. You'll find it interesting.

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,800
Oh, Black.

101
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
- Don't do it to me. - Right there.

102
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,119
- Yes, right there! - Okay, that's enough.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
(Oh, Black. Right there!)

104
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:37,160
Gosh, seriously.

105
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,040
My gosh. Why is she so good at it?

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,518
My precious sweetheart, it looks nicer than usual because you're...

107
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,720
grinding the ink stick for me.

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
What do you think?

109
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,839
It looks so beautiful...

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,839
that I feel like a butterfly will come and sit on it any moment now.

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,999
I want to retire and start a new chapter of my life...

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,600
so I can focus on my art.

113
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,439
You should do that, Father.

114
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,599
You're engaged to a successful man,

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
and the company is doing well.

116
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,959
I think Cha Min can start running the company now,

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
but when are you two planning to get married?

118
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,879
Father.

119
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,638
I do not want to raise my voice at anyone.

120
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,438
Of course, you shouldn't.

121
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,519
Calm down. You can do it.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,039
Who'd be most upset if I flew into a rage...

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,000
like a crazy woman?

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,519
- Me, your dad. - Wrong.

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,040
It'd be most upsetting for me.

126
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,559
Hearing foul words coming out of this pretty mouth...

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,920
and this exquisite voice becoming hoarse...

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,720
will turn my beautiful life into a tragedy.

129
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,360
So...

130
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,240
don't make me repeat myself.

131
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,359
What did I say?

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,318
"Moon Cha Min is just a strategic partner."

133
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,160
"I'll never get married."

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,078
Don't think that I've fundamentally changed...

135
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,160
just because I've been looking elegant as of late.

136
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,560
This temper...

137
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,040
runs in the family as you know.

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,959
Hey, you'll hurt your hand.

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,239
My goodness!

140
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,319
Let go.

141
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,239
Hey, let go. That's enough.

142
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,759
Stop! That is enough.

143
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,399
You'll hurt yourself.

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,439
That's enough. I heard you.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Stop!

146
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,240
(Chungdam Heaven)

147
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,600
Hey, Pee-pee!

148
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
Won't you say hello to me?

149
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,159
You see, I never peed my pants.

150
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,958
Come on. Without my help, you totally would have.

151
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,040
I don't know about that. I've been doing Kegel exercises regularly.

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
Goodness. Did you really have to share that with me?

153
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,160
You could've just thanked me.

154
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,199
I guess you really want to hear me say, "Thank you."

155
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,438
I sure do. I'm aching all over right now.

156
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,518
I was going to thank you yesterday...

157
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,559
but couldn't because your fiancee suddenly showed up.

158
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,120
Why didn't you tell me you were engaged?

159
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
Were you going to try your luck with me if I wasn't engaged?

160
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,399
You can never seduce me anyway.

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,639
I mean, I'd never fall for you,

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
knowing what you're after.

163
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,720
This is hilarious.

164
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,839
No, that's not why.

165
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,759
It's because you acted as though you'd never get married...

166
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,089
and that you absolutely didn't believe in people...

167
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,678
or in love.

168
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,119
You see, I totally refuse to deal with psychos like you.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,479
You can work here...

170
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,758
thanks to your psycho boss.

171
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,639
Exactly. Because you're a psycho...

172
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,639
I mean, thank you.

173
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,839
The thing is, I can put up with a psycho boss,

174
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,278
but I would never date a psycho,

175
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,399
no matter how lonely I am.

176
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,480
My gosh.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,839
So you got the job after all.

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes, thankfully.

179
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,758
I have a lot to learn, but I look forward to working with you.

180
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,279
Oh, no worries. I have a lot to learn too.

181
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
First, let me give you a little tour and explain what we do here.

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
Yes, please. I've been so curious.

183
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,279
A social club only rich people can join.

184
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,279
It's a little tiring to use honorifics every single time.

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,559
Can we drop the honorifics?

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,639
Sure, good idea.

187
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,450
(The Playground)

188
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,519
It's like an adult version of a kids cafe where they can play healthily.

189
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,639
I see.

190
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,398
From an early age,

191
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,038
they've had to receive management training and so on,

192
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,239
so they want to just let it all go and play like children,

193
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
according to Mr. Moon.

194
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,959
Elite education from an early age...

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
turned them into such wonderful adults.

196
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,519
Gosh, that scared me.

197
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,879
Mr. Moon is like Pororo the Little Penguin.

198
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,799
He really is like Pororo.

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
(The Social Lounge)

200
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,600
This is the Social Lounge.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,679
As you can see, there's a cultural exhibition going on,

202
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,519
which our members can all enjoy.

203
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,639
The theme of this exhibition is "self-portrait."

204
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,360
And this is...

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,559
Mr. Moon's self-portrait.

206
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,439
This isn't a self-portrait.

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,480
This is the portrait of an umbrella.

208
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,879
He says it's his self-portrait.

209
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,359
(Hesse's Garden)

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,480
As you can see, you can eat and play here all day,

211
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,519
so you naturally bond with those you spend time with.

212
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,360
It's like a social mecca.

213
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,480
Mr. Moon is an exception though.

214
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,480
You're so cool.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,559
You're totally my type. Could I get your number?

216
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,279
"Think of women as lifeless stones."

217
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,679
That's his motto.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,960
No wonder I thought he was sly and weird.

219
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,279
He doesn't suit this paradise.

220
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,639
I know.

221
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,678
(Chungdam Heaven)

222
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,518
I hope you become an employee who suits Chungdam Heaven.

223
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,559
Please.

224
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,200
Don't you worry.

225
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
I'll show you I can adjust quickly like a bullfrog.

226
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,799
- Good luck. - Thanks.

227
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,519
Hello.

228
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,679
Oh, I guess you're new.

229
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,079
Yes, she is.

230
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Did you just join the company?

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,839
Yes. I'm warm and toasty, fresh out of the oven.

232
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,919
She's not out of the oven yet.

233
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,159
She needs to be baked a little longer.

234
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,039
Let's go back into the flames.

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,200
I mean, let's get you trained.

236
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,638
Why is my honey...

237
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,320
walking side by side with that woman, looking like a couple?

238
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,120
He wants to teach her a real lesson.

239
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
"A real lesson?"

240
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,038
Well, that newbie had the audacity to say...

241
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,759
that she came here to marry a good catch.

242
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Mr. Moon will crush that ridiculous dream of hers...

243
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
and make her behave herself.

244
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,879
But why would he go to such lengths?

245
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,039
He was with her yesterday too.

246
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,399
I suppose she's on his special watch list.

247
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,840
Why did you bring me here?

248
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Are you going to lock me in a tower or something?

249
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
Do you think you're a princess?

250
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,599
You're my employee.

251
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,559
I brought you here so you can work without getting distracted.

252
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,440
Don't you worry.

253
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,679
I am far from the princess type.

254
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,320
See this?

255
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,200
Yes.

256
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,440
You have such perfect arms to do laundry with.

257
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,039
You're going to do this. Not me.

258
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,519
It looks ivory now,

259
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,918
but I want it to look white.

260
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,638
But I think ivory is nicer.

261
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,479
It's such a nice, warm shade.

262
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,559
Don't be ridiculous.

263
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Make it look pristine white like the first snow.

264
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,960
It's Venetian handmade lace.

265
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,480
Hand-wash it very carefully so it won't fray.

266
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,159
What? I have to hand-wash them?

267
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,600
Then it'll take forever to wash these.

268
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Well...

269
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,200
You can do it if you devote your youth to it.

270
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,919
Wash this too.

271
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,440
Why are you here?

272
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Oh, hello.

273
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,320
I have to wash these.

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,240
I heard you came here to find a good catch to marry.

275
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,559
Rumours do travel fast.

276
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,799
I don't want to deny my dreams.

277
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,518
If your dream is to marry well, you shouldn't be here.

278
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,200
You need to go to the Wish Pavilion.

279
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,879
"Wish Pavilion?"

280
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,200
- Young Bae. - Yes, sir.

281
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,519
Are there more petty tasks to be done?

282
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Not really.

283
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,720
You want to dump them on Jae Rim again, don't you?

284
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Gosh, please don't do that.

285
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,199
Mr. Moon. Because you're so harsh on the newbie,

286
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
we don't even need to discipline her.

287
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,720
You were never like this in the past. What's with you?

288
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,878
I want to do it my way and train her strictly.

289
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,840
Cinderella's mean stepmother isn't at home.

290
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,919
Don't mind me. Just do what you need to do.

291
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,158
She's right here, at Cinderella's workplace.

296
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,639
What's she listening to...

297
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,879
that she seems to be having so much fun?

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,519
The two of them simultaneously started...

299
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,559
to desire each other, relying solely...

300
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,650
on their sense of touch and hearing.

301
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
Then their steamy breath...

302
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
quickly filled the room.

303
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,200

Gosh, give it back.

307

Hey, you. I can't believe you jumped on me.

308
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,599
You got the wrong idea.

309
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,359
Whatever you were imagining, you got the wrong idea.

310
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,170
You think you're an innocent bride?

311
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,720
You're a dirty-minded pervert.

312
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,170
What?

313
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,410
Oh, my.

314
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,239
I am not a pervert.

315
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,919
And about this. My friend recorded this audiobook.

316
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,358
It was auto-played.

317
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,679
I swear, I'm not into that stuff.

318
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,759
It's bad that you're dumping this on your friend.

319
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,799
Confidently admit that you're into it. I don't care.

320
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,170
I'm telling you the truth.

Gosh.

322
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,240
My friend is a voice actress.

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,118
She's now on YouTube because she was struggling financially.

324

So it's not doing well either, so I have to watch her videos.

325
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,170
Could you "like" her video too?

326
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,239
I have to press the like button too?

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
I thought you'd complain that you couldn't do it.

333
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
I'm a good worker, you see.

334
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,650
With that said,

335
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,920
could I get proper tasks?

336
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,279
No, I'm anxious that you'll make mistakes.

337
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,889
You dislike me that much,

338
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,720
but you still hired me. You're such a weirdo.

339
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,559
That's right. I am a weirdo.

340
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,519
You see, I'm not as dangerous as you think I am.

341
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,410
I'm harmless.

342
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,599
That's what you think.

343
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,079
It's just your opinion.

344
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
Gosh, he's so mean.

345
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,920
("The Unthinkable Affair With Tom Black")

346
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
"The Unthinkable Affair With Tom Black?"

347
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,410
Gosh, you scared me.

348
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,599
Hey. By any chance,

349
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,839
do you like Shin Jae Rim?

350
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,439
What are you talking about? As the CEO...

351
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,890
But you're not a hands-on CEO.

352
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,758
Why would I like her?

353
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,239
You keep picking on her and no one else.

354
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,559
Like a little boy and his first love.

355
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,079
What? A little boy's first love?

356
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,119
Have you lost your mind?

357
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,720
She's a total pervert.

358
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,719
You two have already shared such preferences?

359
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,759
Hey.

360
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,039
Don't insult me like this.

361
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,960
Then prove it.

362
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,890
How could I prove my feelings?

363
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,759
Make her quit as soon as possible...

364
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,119
by helping her become Cinderella.

365
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,240
That will be best for everyone's sake.

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,759
And it'll be fun.

367
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,170
- You don't want that? - Just leave her be.

368
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,480
I really don't care what she becomes.

369
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Really?

370
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,240
Then pay more attention to me,

371
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,200
so I won't explode in rage.

372
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,279
You really are like the 9pm news.

373
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,839
Does it mean...

374
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,759
I'm that important to you now?

375
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,119
I mean, you make me anxious for no reason.

376
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,359
Leave, will you?

377
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,960
I did laundry all day and couldn't even step out.

378
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,920
Had I known I'd have to put up with this,

379
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,439
I would've gotten a job at a gym in the financial district...

380
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,960
or at a bar in front of the court to find a suitor.

381
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,799
Oh, boy.

382
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,680
My legs hurt too.

383
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,559
My gosh.

384
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,839
Is it nice to have landed the dream job you wanted?

385
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,119
- Are you excited? - I want to get married soon.

386
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,839
So, you haven't learned your lesson yet.

387
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,960
Tomorrow, let's clean all the balls in the ball pit.

388
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,359
Let's work hard.

389
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,879
Then what did you do today, boss?

390
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,279
Hey, what is Chungdam Heaven?

391
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,200
People come here to play and rest.

392
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,679
The things I do to play and relax here symbolize Chungdam Heaven...

393
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,118
and help promote the business.

394
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,599
What are you, Pororo the Little Penguin? Must you play every day?

395
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,960
There's something I always say.

396
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,559
"Follow your joy."

397
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,960
"Joy?" Gosh, that obnoxious jerk.

398
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,559
Shall I just quit?

399
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,399
(Sang Chul)

400
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
I received the money you sent this month.

401
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,559
You must be working really hard. Thanks.

402
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,079
I can't keep on living like this.

403

(In the Mood for Flowers)

404
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,920
It is the only way.

405
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,599
"Wish Pavilion?"

406
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,078
Your predecessor, Sin Ae,

407
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,598
got what she wanted after making a wish there.

408
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,160
They say the place makes your prayers come true.

409
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,200
And they only charge 1,000 dollars to pray for you.

410
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,480
I can turn my life around with just 1,000 dollars?

411
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,119
I shall risk my life to get the money.

412
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,118
The ideas we get when we're bewitched by something...

413
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,920
tend to be reckless most of the time.

414
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,559
Be careful.

415
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,599
Hey, why are you here?

416
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,599
You have a job now. Why not have chicken and beer near your work?

417
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,799
I need to borrow some money.

418
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,079
I'll pay you back when I get paid.

419
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,000
- Just lend me 1,000 dollars. - What do you need the money for?

420
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,960
I have to make a wish.

421
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,559
Why must you spend money to make a wish?

422
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,919
Did the deities say you must pay them to get your wish granted?

423
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,639
There's this mysterious place where someone prays for you...

424
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,279
and makes your wishes come true.

425
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,838
Hey, that's called a cult. Have you lost your mind?

426
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,440
No, someone's wish actually came true.

427
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,159
There's a witness.

428
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,599
What's your desperate wish that you're willing to waste money on it?

429
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,160
I want to marry well.

430
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,079
Hey, are you possessed or something?

431
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,919
Get it together!

432
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I am doing this because I'm trying to get my act together.

433
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,879
For me, marriage is the only solution.

434
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,240
You can't get out of that mess because you think like that.

435
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,519
Then what? Should I go back to school?

436
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
What can I get out of studying so hard?

437
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,160
Would I be able to get a job?

438
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,518
Fine. Let's say I managed to get a job.

439
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,559
Can I buy a home?

440
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,599
These days, you can't buy a home in Seoul even if you win the lottery.

441
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,880
Hey, this world was built in such a way...

442
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,759
that you can't do anything unless you were born into a wealthy family.

443
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,758
So I want to snatch up a rich guy...

444
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,640
and turn my life around. Why are you criticizing me?

445
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,759
You're just like your father.

446
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,759
That's all you saw and learned while growing up.

447
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
Yes, that I admit.

448
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,640
But you know what? They truly loved each other.

449
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,079
That's enough, isn't it?

450
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,240
Also,

451
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,759
I call your mother "Mom." Why are you still calling him like that?

452
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,519
He is your father. How else am I supposed to address him, then?

453
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,000
Fine, forget it.

454
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,480
That's why I never call you my sister either.

455
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,518
That little brat.

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,799
Goodness.

459
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
Why are you here again? To extort money from me?

460
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,319
I'm broke. Stop taking my money.

461
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm here to remove your eye boogers.

462
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,279
Goodness. The other eye.

463
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,440
Gosh. Have you not been washing your face?

464
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,759
- My nose boogers too. - Gosh.

465
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,240
What? You think your father is dirty?

466
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,160
Why would I extort money from my jobless father?

467
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,839
You aren't working anymore, just like me.

468
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,399
I'm not sure if the strategic relationship...

469
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,319
with Dan A's family can last without you two getting married.

470
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,879
Yes, it'll be fine.

471
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,839
You're bedridden like this because you worry all the time.

472
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,959
Hey, the advice I gave you is worth 300 million dollars.

473
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,919
- Never forget that. - Okay, I won't.

474
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,160
Say it once more, and I'll never forget it.

475

Men like us must think of women as lifeless stones.

476

Don't check women out.

477
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,400
Women are stones.

478
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,200
Mr. Moon Bo Hyun, are you all right?

479
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,119
I feel better now that you're here.

480
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,199
Don't worry. He's fine.

481
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,920
The doctor will examine you tomorrow morning.

482
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,240
All right, thank you.

483
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,078
Get me more books.

486

I'm reading this book for the third time.

487
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,279
Buy a complete collection.

488
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
- Bye. - The original edition in English.

489
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
I keep getting useless thoughts.

490
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,920

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Soo Jin.

495
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,680
Oh, Jae Rim.

496
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
What brings you here?

497
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,839
Oh, one moment.

498
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,880
Yes, right.

499
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,839
Okay. Got it.

500
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,799
Hey, I have to go.

501
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,400
Jae Rim, let's talk later at home.

502
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,720
All right.

503
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,440
Hi, sister-in-law. What's up?

504
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,319
You can tell me. I'm not busy right now.

505
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,440
Who's your sister-in-law?

506
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,719
Hey, don't talk to him. He likes to talk nonsense.

507
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,759
Anyway, bye.

508
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,759
Sister-in-law, I know why you're here.

509
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
I bet you came here hoping to borrow money from your sister.

510
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,119
How did you know?

511
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,680
Hey, I'm a doctor. I could tell at a glance.

512
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,200
Your eyes looked like those of a desperate debtor.

513
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,680
You see, I have a lot of money.

514
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,759
How much do you need?

515
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,599
A thousand dollars.

516
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,720
Hey, you're cute. I could just give you a thousand dollars.

517
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
- My gosh. - I mean, I could.

518
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,119
But there's a condition.

519
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,039
I want to know Soo Jin's ring size.

520
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,359
Can you help me?

521
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,119
I want to win your sister's heart...

522
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,400
with a big diamond ring.

523
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,079
Help me out. Please?

524
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,960
I swear, I saw it around here.

525
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,799
This is a win-win situation for all parties involved.

526
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,278
Soo Jin, stop living the hard life as the eldest daughter...

527
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,359
and the breadwinner of the family.

528
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,400
I support this marriage.

529
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,518
Nice. I shall ride the lucky wave and keep going...

530
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,680
until I reach my final destination!

531
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,119
Gosh, that scared me.

532
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
My gosh.

533
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,519
This place is spooky.

534
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,358
Someone at Chungdam Heaven recommended you.

535
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm here to make a wish.

536
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,039
Oh. You're from Cheongdam-dong, the land of ambition?

537
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,880
So? What's your wish?

538
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,839
I want to marry well...

539
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,319
and turn my life around.

540
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,559
I see. You're one ambitious lady.

541
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,119
Desire of daughter, in English.

542
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
"Desire?"

543
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,598
It's the other way around. "Daughter of desire."

544
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,599
I see.

545
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,519
You see, I have nothing,

546
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,440
but I want to be loved.

547
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,000
No, I mean... You know, I want to be...

548
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,839
showered with love.

549
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,838
- Like this. - A love shower.

550
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,440
- Yes. - A love shower, I see.

551
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,039
It'll cleanse every corner of my body.

552
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,399
With an abundance of love from a successful man.

553
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,839
I want to be soaked from head to toe.

554
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,839
Do you think I can experience such amazing love?

555
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,559
Right now, I'm a nobody who has nothing, but if I...

556
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,200
receive some proper love from a wonderful man,

557
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,400
I may be able to become somebody who has a lot to offer.

558
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
It's possible.

559
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
You really think so?

560
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,359
Anyone can love because love isn't picky when it comes...

561
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,759
to deciding on whose door it'll knock.

562
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Why is that?

563
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:42,319
I don't know if something's wrong with Cupid's eyes or whatever,

564
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,559
but he's bad at aiming.

565
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,880
Cupid?

566
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,559
The two of them simultaneously started...

567
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,440
to desire each other, relying solely...

568
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
on their sense of touch and hearing.

569
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,160
Then their steamy breath...

570
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,720
quickly filled the room.

571
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,480
No, Tom Black. Not there.

572
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,239
("The Unthinkable Affair With Tom Black")

573
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,279
This is...

574
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,200
unthinkable.

575
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,039
Hey. By any chance,

576
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,480
do you like Shin Jae Rim?

577
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,839
Why would I like her unless I've lost my mind?

578
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,319
She's not attractive at all.

579
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,440
(Sexy, provocative)

580
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,160
Shin Jae Rim.

581
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,720
She's dangerous. She really is.

582
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,519
Enjoy.

583
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,200
Thanks for the food.

584
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,200
So? Did you manage to get the money?

585
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,519
Mind your own business.

586
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,039
You refused to lend me money.

587
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,200
Jae Rim, do you need an allowance?

588
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,118
You've been cooking instead of me.

589
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,559
Shall I give you an allowance?

590
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,759
No, it's okay.

591
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,479
Spend your money to get what you need.

592
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,079
Has anyone seen my ring I left here?

593
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,279
Is it a gold ring?

594
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,759
Can you make money by selling it?

595
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,518
No, it's a silver ring.

596
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,319
It'll tarnish if it's left out. I looked for it, but it's not there.

597
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,160
- Jae Rim. - Yes?

598
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,119
What did you want to talk to me about yesterday?

599
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,759
Oh, that.

600
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
It was nothing important.

601
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,519
I should get ready for work. Enjoy your breakfast.

602
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,400
Mom, I want an allowance too.

603
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,359
Dream on.

604
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,079
(Chungdam Heaven)

605
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,329
Oh, my.

606
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,719
What are you cooking up that you got here so early?

607
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,519
I am not cooking up anything.

608
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,599
I came early to clean all the balls first...

609
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,599
since I didn't want to spend another day in solitary confinement.

610
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,000
You may begin your official duties as of today.

611
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,079
Why the sudden change of heart?

612
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,598
Just because you want to marry well,

613
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,039
it doesn't mean it will actually happen.

614
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,119
I shouldn't have been concerned to begin with.

615
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,039
You won't marry well even if you try.

616
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
You're belittling me now, aren't you?

617
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,400
Because Prince Cha Min...

618
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,558
has been suppressing his urges for too long,

619
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,880
even the littlest things Jae Rim does...

620
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,599
are turning him into a sunfish.

621
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,768
Please don't walk up to me like that all of a sudden.

622
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,809
Why? What did I even do?

623
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:17,880
You stink.

624
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,079
Stay away from me! Please.

625
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,329
Why does she keep trying to invade my personal space?

626
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,360
Gosh, seriously!

627
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,639
Gosh. What could it be?

628
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,599
I don't smell anything.

629
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,289
No way.

630
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,039
Could it be the smell of poverty, which only the wealthy can detect?

631
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,000
Yes, it smells like wealth.

632
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Darn it.

633
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,679
I do smell...

634
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:29,880
like poverty.

635
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,519
What are you doing?

636
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,039
- Are you doing nosework? - Hey, do I smell?

637
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:43,599
No, you don't.

638
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:44,769
I don't?

639
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,679
I guess you didn't shower.

640
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,440
- I did. - No, you did not.

641
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,999
- I did shower. - No, you didn't.

642
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,239
I swear, I took a shower. Hey, seriously!

643
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:59,519
He said I stank when I didn't even smell.

644
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,599
I'm a woman too. I'm offended.

645
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,329
Carry your wish note around and read it whenever you can.

646
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,558
You'll engrave it in your mind.

647
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,679
(Chungdam Heaven)

648
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,329
With this clear awareness of your wish, your mind...

649
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,159
will lead you to the fate you desire.

650
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
(A big guy!)

651
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,519
The more detailed your wish is, the better.

652
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,039
What kind of man do you want to meet?

653
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,480
Paint a picture of your ideal type.

654
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,480
Paint a picture?

655
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,079
Then I should describe the physical traits.

656
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,840
A big guy.

657
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
Someone who's tall.

658
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,440
Why is it that my heart flutters when I see a tall man?

659
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,769
When I look up at a tall guy,

660
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,559
I can stretch my text neck.

661
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,400
It's really nice.

662
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:24,719
I won't have to ask him who his father is...

663
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,769
because his well-defined facial features would be screaming,

664
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,519
"I was sculpted by Michelangelo!"

665
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,679
And six-pack abs.

666
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,679
They say your core muscles are so important.

667
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,480
In this chaotic world, I'll hold on to him tight...

668
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,119
and never waver!

669
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,439
The reckless way Cupid shoots arrows at people...

670
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,400
often complicates things.

671
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,159
But if you keep going round and round,

672
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,559
you're bound...

673
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,960
to find your true love eventually.
