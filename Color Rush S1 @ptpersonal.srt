My aunt doesn't recall the fact that mom was wearing a headband the day she disappeared.

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,870
But I do.

5
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,220
However, because I'm Mono,

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,480
I don't know what color headband it was.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,910
I see things in the shades of gray, so I can't say.

00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,920
A man in his forties kidnapped and kept a woman in her thirties captive.

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,180
According to the people around him, he is a Mono,

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,800
and became obsessed with the kidnapped victim because when he saw her, he was able to identify colors.

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,760
People with a monochromatic vision, those who see the world only in shades of gray, are called Mono.

15
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,810
We're different from those who have total color blindness.

16
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,920
Our cone cells aren't impaired, but our brains can't distinguish the colors.
(T/N: cone cells  are the cells in the retina that identify colors.)

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,860
We are able to see colors if we look at a certain someone.

18
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,500
And that person... who opens up the world of colors is known as Probe.

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,410
The issue is that it's very rare for a Mono and Probe to meet

20
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:41,010
and there are some who don't ever get a chance to meet.

21
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,150
Monos show strong obsession towards Probes because they worry that they will lose the ability to see colors again

22
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,220
and their obsession results in crimes.

23
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,660
It's only right for Monos and Probes to never meet one another.

32
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,450
I don't know who it is but someone threatened to kill me if I look into the mono case again.

No, I'm too dizzy.

Why? Is it because you can see colors now?

The ocean I know was of a different color.

nor did I intend to and never will.

160
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,650
Is it because I'm the Probe?

You still need to rest.

Don't look at me like that.

- Why?
- Because...

171

there are cases where Monos kidnapped their Probes, killed those in their lives,

172
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,370
and ate their Probes after killing them.

173

Don't you get how serious this situation is?

174
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,600
No, not really.

175

Let's make a deal. I'll teach you the colors of this world,

177
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,280

179
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,410
I'm not interested.

180

Are you a Mono?

181
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,360
Yes, I am.

182
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,960
I knew it.

For now, we told the others you fainted after seeing a ghost.

184
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,150
A ghost?

185
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,270
We figured that's better than everyone knowing you're a Mono.

186
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,420
- Did grandpa Min Jae—
- You're right.

187
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,430
It's the spirit of a grandpa that possessed Min Jae.

188
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,190
Last year, some bullies picked a fight with Min Jae thinking he was a Mono,

189
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,730
and Min Jae went, "Don't you ride that motorcycle!"

190
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,980
to one guy. Then, to those standing beside him, he went,

191
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,460
"Don't you stare at that tree, and don't you get on the back of that motorcycle."

192
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,890
Like that.

193
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,520
At that time, what he said got them all worked up,

194
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,650
however, that very weekend while riding the motorcycle, they collided

195
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,390
with a truck at the intersection.

196
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,350
One ended up under the truck, while the other was nowhere to be seen.

197
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,680
As their friends and the police looked everywhere for him.

198
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,480
one of their friends fainted from shock.

199
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,260
It turns out that the one riding on the back flew straight into...

200
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,840
a tree. His tongue was hanging long.

201
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,550
That's why our school doesn't have bullies anymore.

202
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,120
If anyone bothers you, the grandpa spirit of Min Jae...

203
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,580
I told you that isn't the case.

204
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,600
My grandpa just has the ability to see the future a little, that's all.

205
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,230
That's what he said.

206
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,140
That's true. Even if he's a ghost, how powerful could an old ghost be?

207
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,340
Still, if anyone picks a fight with you, we'll be there to fend them off.

208

Why, though?

209
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,650
Because we're friends. Isn't it obvious?

210
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,520
- Yeon Woo doesn't have any friends.
- Can't you say it quietly?

211
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,960
- Wait, did the grandpa say that?
- Yes.

212
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,360
I'm grateful you're treating me without bias, but it's easier for me to be alone.

The color of the ocean?

The ocean I know was of a different color. So, this is the color of that water.

Although she fainted on the streets and injured her knees because of it, she said that she liked it very much.

The male mantis risked its life in its attempt to mate.

The female mantis eats the male mantis even during mating.

241

The male mantis initiates mating even though it knows it will lose its life.

Because I'm a Probe?

No, because I feel like you're going to say nonsense.

346

I've never said any nonsense. I've always been genuine.

You're right. It is lonesome.

You're not going to put it on me?

You were crying a lot.

That is something Monos experience as they are adjusting to their Probe.

I'm feeling his absence only because I just got used to his presence.

636
00:58:53,910 --> 00:59:01,290
When I walked around the school field during lunchtime alone, it was so peaceful that it felt weird.

637
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:07,200
I felt anxious like I was procrastinating or pushing something off.

638
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,890
♫ Always be there for you ♫

Yeon Woo

640
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,780
Choi Yeon Woo

641
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,830
My Yeon Woo

642
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,370
My Yeon Woo is the most tender beef.
(T/N: he means that Yeon Woo is tender-hearted.)

643
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,260
Have you ever played with color?

644
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,890
No, I haven't. Why?

645
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:26,930
♫ I'll find you no matter where you are
I never once forgot any of those days ♫

646
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,560
How in the world do you play with color?

647
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,220
Rather than never being able to see color again,

648
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:36,680
I didn't like the feeling of loss the moment the colors started fading.

649
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,660
What do I do if he leaves

650
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,320
after forcing his way into my life?

651
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:49,020
♫ When I close my eyes I hear your breathing ♫

652
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,290
Let's go see an exhibit.

653
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:59,930
♫ I’ll wait for you here every day ♫

654
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,990
I really wanted to see this with you.

655
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,990
Media art.

656
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:13,940
Let me escort you to a world where the flowers become you, and you become the flowers.

657
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,990
What are you talking about?

658
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,200
Yeon Woo, we're going into the starlight now.

659
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,550
Will it be okay if you pass out today?

660
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,190
I won't pass out.

661
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:52,470
Today, I'm going to bear it, no matter what.

662
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:57,860
Okay. The world where the flowers become you and you become the flowers.

663
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,390
I'll show it to you now.

664
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,890
It's beautiful.

665
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:54,580
♫ Oh I will be fine. You don’t have to worry ♫

666
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:00,070
♫ The way you look at me, I think about you, again and again ♫

667
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:05,550
♫ When our eyes meet, I am reborn ♫

668
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,110
Even if I become dependent on the Probe,

669
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:12,200
even if I become like the Monos on TV who do those heinous things,

670
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,680
I still want to see colors.

671
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,500
That's what I desire.

672
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:23,930
♫ So you can be even more freer ♫

673

674

♫ I’ll find wherever you go ♫

677
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,020
- How are you getting home?
- Me? I'm taking the bus.

678
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,920
♫ Oh, oh ♫

679
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,060
Thanks for taking me to the exhibit today.

680
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,270
For finding the exhibit, for showing it to me.

681
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:02,280
For standing by me, so that I can see the colors and explaining them to me.

682
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,520
Get home safe.

683
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,340
Can Probes read minds too?

684
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,910
Hey, let's go home together.

685
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,790
That's too much. No. Let's just pretend that I didn't hear it and go home.

686
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,870
- Is your aunt home?
- No.

687
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:19,210
What the— What did I just say?

688
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,790
- Then what about your father?
- He isn't there.

689
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,120
Then, it'll just be us?

690
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,610
He knows... that I don't have a mother. How much do you know?

691
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:31,070
Go Yoo Han.

692
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,020
Say it.

693
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,100
If I let you come over, will you grant me a wish?

694
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,260
I'll grant any wish.

695
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,950
What are you doing? Hurry up and open the door. I'm hungry.

696
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:54,250
Let's eat ramen. I want to eat ramen.

697
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,810
What is he talking about? Ramen? Oh my goodness.
(T/N: in Korea, the phrase "Wanna come over for ramen?" has an equivalent meaning to "Netflix and chill.")

698
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:00,030
Hurry up and open it.

699
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:06,940
Is this incredibly beautiful woman our Yeon Woo's mother?

700
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,880
What are you doing?

701
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,520
Nothing. The painting called for me.

702
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,610
Yeon Woo, let's sit down

703
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,720
and look at the painting.

704
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:28,320
Mom

705
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,030
disappeared four years ago.

706
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:38,290
Honestly, I've seen the flyer.

707
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:43,220
I thought she looked familiar, but it was because of you.

708
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,470
I want to see this painting.

709
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:51,360
I want to see the true colors of this painting that my father drew.

710
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,820
That's my wish.

711
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:56,700
Don't cry. I'll let you see it.

712
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,190
That's why I came here.

713
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,390
Yeon Woo.

714
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,600
Just hold on a bit longer.

715
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,860
Sky...

716
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,380
Her sky blue dress.

717
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,950
Mom...

718
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,750
Her brown shoes.

719
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,980
Red lips.

720
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,130
Yellow....

721
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:59,220
Your headband was yellow, Mom.

722
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:04,240
This is how your true smile looked like.

723
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,430
This is the aura you have.

724
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,970
Where are you, Mom?

725
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,230
I can tell you everything now.

726
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:17,390
I can teach you the colors.

727
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:31,640
Mom told me that

728
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,040
we were looking at the same world.

729
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,370
That the world wasn't gray, that it had beautiful colors.

730
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:45,990
I'll become your color.

731
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,420
I'm by your side.

732
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,270
I'll become your color.

733
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:02,790
Why are you so handsome?

734
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,620
Yeon Woo,

735
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,610
are you okay?

736
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,490
Doesn't your head hurt?

737
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,350
It hurts.

738
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeon Woo, stay behind me.

739
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,670
Aunt!

740
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:06,060
Aunt?

741
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,180
Who's this kid?

742
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,310
So this is what Aunt looks like...

743
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,730
This kid...

744
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,350
No violence! You can't use violence.

745
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,680
What are you?

746
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,950
I'm a friend from his class.

747
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,440
A friend?

748
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,450
A friend...

749
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,640
Yes.

750
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,180
We're not that close yet.

751
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,680
Aunt, look at the uniform. It's the same, isn't it?

752
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,750
- I'm Yeon Woo's one—
- Yeon Woo doesn't have any friends.

753
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,780
Who are you?

754
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,840
No, Aunt. I made a friend.

755
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
He really is my friend.

756
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,400
I'm the closest with Yeon Woo.

757
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:11,060
See? It's a good thing you transferred schools. You made a friend.

758
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,610
I heard you were a PD.

759
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:16,560
Yeah, I am for a night show called "Investigating for the Truth."

760
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,500
Okay, then.

761
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:24,320
I, Go Yoo Han, Yeon Woo's closest friend, will head home now.

762
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
Alright, you should quickly go home.

763
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,880
Your parents will be worried.

764
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,170
- Choi Yeon Woo.
- Yeah?

765
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,580
Aren't you going to walk me home?

766
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:37,480
Guess you're not that close after all. I guess only you consider that.

767
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,860
Aunt, I'll be back.

768
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,850
Hurry back soon. I'm hungry.

769
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:49,330
Oh right! Ramen...

770
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:51,130
I'll be back.

771
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,380
What is he talking about?

772
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:00,410
Why are you so elated?

773
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,460
Is it because you're happy your aunt is home?

774
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,130
Put your mask on.

775
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:05,000
My mask!

776
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,170
You haven't been wearing it since earlier.

777
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:09,800
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

778
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,550
You scared me.

779
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,380
Hey! My hair.

780
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:22,650
I can still see colors. Decoloring hasn't happened yet.

781
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,860
Really? It must mean you've gotten used to it.

782
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,450
You've gotten more used to it because you have feelings for me!

783
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,610
No, that's not it.

784
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,800
That over there is blue.

785
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,390
That over there is yellow.

786
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,790
Yes, yellow.

787
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,720
That over there is...

788
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,850
- Neon
- Neon?

789
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,190
Because the original color was mixed with luminescence.

790
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:01,960
That is blue mixed with luminescence, so it's neon blue.

791
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:07,530
Yeon Woo, what color do you think that café's sign over there is?

792
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,520
Yellow?

793

[Ultra Marine Masterpiece Special Exhibition]

794
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:26,760
In the past, ultramarine, a type of blue paint, was an expensive paint.

795
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,560
At that time, Europe had to import lapis lazuli.
(T/N: lapis lazuli is a deep-blue metamorphic rock.)

796
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,630
For the reason that it was made from lapis lazuli from beyond the sea, the name ultramarine was given.

797
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:41,920
It was popular for its vivid blue color before the development of synthetic dye.

798
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,960
If we were to calculate the cost today, it would be about $1,500 for 1 kg.

799
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,970
In the past, due to its expensive cost, noble clients

800
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:55,400
would buy the paint for painters and inspect to see if they were using it properly.

801
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,230
It must've been an ordeal.

802
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:04,010
In the painting, the blue color was used to express Virgin Mary's clothes.

803
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,090
And that over there...

804
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:12,110
The reason why the sky is clear and not blue was to save the paint.

805
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,540
However, lapis lazuli isn't that expensive.

806
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,580
Lapis lazuli?

807
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,110
That's what they call chunggeumsuk now.
(T/N: chunggeumsuk is lapis lazuli in Korean.)

808
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:22,410
A lot of lapis lazuli was used to make the ultramarine pigment.

809
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:28,790
At that time, it was expensive because it had to be quarried from Afghanistan.

810
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:34,170
Now, well, they don't even consider it a gem or a semi-precious metal.

I have one lying around at my house. Do you want to see it?

Yes, I want to see it.

Over there. That purplish blue is indigo blue.

That's right. You said blue was very valuable... because of lapis lazuli.

1112
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:17,790
I have one at home.

1113
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:20,240
I'll definitely show you sometime later.

1114
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,480
I would love to see it.

1115
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,670
Are there a lot of shades of blue?

1116
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:31,690
It has the most shades out of all because blue is a popular color.

1117
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:36,060
The shades that are named after an everyday object are: blue, teal,

1118
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,050
water blue, sky blue,

1119
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,350
cyan, cerulean blue, pastel blue,

1120
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:43,530
powder blue, sky gray,

1121
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:46,620
ocean blue, mint, Prussian blue,

1122
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:51,220
indigo blue, cobalt blue, sapphire, navy.

1123
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,830
There are other shades like azurite blue,

1124
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:55,750
ultramarine, azure,

1125
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:59,390
royal blue, French turquoise, turquoise,

1126
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:01,820
empire blue, Indian blue,

1127
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:04,260
aqua blue, marine blue,

1128
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,720
lavender blue, Prussian blue,

1129
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,030
Egyptian blue, Matisse blue,

1130
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,840
lapis lazuli, majolica blue,

1131
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,480
midnight blue, moonlight blue,

1132
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,830
navy blue, Nile blue,

1133
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,910
Spode blue, saxe blue,

1134
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,670
Versailles.

1135
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:22,860
What?

1136
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,530
Why? Was there something strange among them?

1137
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:27,680
There's still a lot of shades left.

1138
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:33,660
Well... I thought I heard a word that didn't belong among the blues.

1139
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:36,410
Which one?

1140
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:41,780
Color names can come from people, regions,

1141
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,660
and even countries.

1142
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:47,020
I don't get which one seems misplaced.

1143
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,070
- You said "sex" blue.
- Right.
(T/N: he's talking about saxe blue. They sound the same but have a different spelling.)

1144
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:52,220
That's the actual name?

1145
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:56,140
It's named after Saxony, a state along Germany's Elbe River.

1146
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:59,760
Sa-xe bl-ue.

1147
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:05,300
S-a-x-e  b-l-u-e

1148
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:08,490
- Oh, it's named after a region.
- Yeah.

1149
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:11,080
It was a good approach.

1150
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:16,150
Out of the seven deadly sins in Christianity, blue is said to symbolize lust.

1151
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:18,460
So sex blue could exist.

1152
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:23,320
Yeon Woo, what do you think? Could that be my color?

1153
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:27,650
I didn't know there could be this many shades of blue.

1154
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:32,490
The world of color is as infinite as one's love for another.

1155
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:35,420
Go Yoo Han, how did you memorize all of these?

1156
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,850
Is that the end?

1157
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:42,190
There's probably more if I search, but that's all I memorized.

1158
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,630
That's amazing. How did you memorize all of these?

1159
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:50,000
I can remember them all when I just think of you. All I want is to teach them to you.

1160
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,710
♫ The words I kept to myself ♫

1161
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:56,160
♫ I'm going to confess to you now ♫

1162
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:03,210
♫ More than any words, when I close my eyes ♫

1163
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,700
♫  I hear your breathing  ♫

1164
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,700
Why are you looking at me when you should be looking at the ocean?

1165
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,520
It feels like a dream when I look at you.

1166
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,730
That's what I wanted to say.

1167
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:17,610
But he said it first.

1168
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,210
- Do you think there's a payphone here?
- Why?

1169
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:24,920
I'm going to call my aunt.

1170
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,680
If I don't, she might die from worrying.

1171
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,930
Let's do that then.

1172
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,850
Don't worry.

1173
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:36,300
What? Really?

1174
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:39,880
Then, Yoo Han—

1175
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:45,310
I understand.

1176
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:47,660
I said I understand!

1177
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,230
What's wrong?

1178
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,560
Why are you acting like this?

1179
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,060
Go back to Seoul quickly.

1180
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,150
Was your aunt really angry?

1181
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:09,210
It's not my family but yours.

1182
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,810
- Is your mom a congresswoman?
- Yes.

1183
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:14,820
Your older sister is a judge, your older brother is a military officer,

1184
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:16,280
and your dad's the chairman of Taejong Group?

1185
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,360
Yes, they are.

1186
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:22,090
What?

1187
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:25,180
I'm hungry!

1188
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:27,410
Buy me.

1189
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:40,290
If you don't return by today, they're going to report me as your kidnapper.

1190
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:43,760
The political world, the financial world, and the military world. Is there something like that?

1191
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,480
Anyway, it seems they are all ready for action.

1192
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:53,450
According to my aunt, the situation seemed like there was an arrest warrant in place for the Mono who kidnapped his Probe.

1193
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:54,750
So, how can you eat?

1194
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:58,150
In a situation like this, we need to eat to gain strength.

1195
01:45:58,150 --> 01:45:59,960
Okay.

1196
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,880
You should eat a lot.

1197
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,630
Here you go.

1198
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:13,620
I couldn't reach you, and you didn't show up to school, so I asked,

1199
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:17,990
and your aunt told me you will be transferring because you were very obsessed with me.

1200
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:22,950
The congresswoman in my family thinks that since you may have a plan to kidnap me,

1201
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:25,850
she'll stop you from approaching me.

1202
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:31,030
So I thought about it... and there's only one answer.

1203
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,480
Finding me and running away?

1204
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,600
So that's how we ended up like this.

1205
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,920
But, it's dangerous for a Probe to be around a Mono.

1206
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,550
Both your mom and my aunt are right.

1207
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:50,590
I shouldn't be allowed to be around you.

1208
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,850
That's what is right.

1209
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:56,620
A restraining order is only for when both parties are alive.

1210
01:46:56,620 --> 01:47:00,930
Who cares about that when you were willing to die for me?

1211
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:02,620
I like you.

1212
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:09,060
But, I'll obsess over you, I'll doubt you,

1213
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:12,770
and end up killing you.

1214
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,800
It's right to stay away from me.

1215
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,790
Yeon Woo, do you want to know a secret?

1216
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:27,630
The truth is I can't identify people's faces.

1217
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:32,750
I have prosopagnosia, a condition that prevents me from even recognizing Jung Joo Haeng, a friend since elementary school.
(T/N: prosopagnosia is a neurological condition characterized by the inability to recognize the faces of familiar people.)

1218
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,700
That's me.

1219
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:41,200
I was smart though, so I was able to distinguish them

1220
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:45,890
by their voice, gaits, clothes, and habits.

1221
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:06,620
But, I was able to tell you apart.

1222
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:17,430
It was the first time I could distinguish someone's face.

1223
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:28,850
When our eyes meet, and I see your color moving, I can recognize you.

when you face me, your eyes whisper to me.

They whisper to me.

Then, I can picture your face, and that face is what I see.

1239
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:39,040
When you're not around, I picture you over and over again. Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of times.

1240
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,320
But I can't recognize you when I do that.

Telling me that I'm the only one he can distinguish.

1245
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:58,460
The fact that he can't picture my face when we're apart.

1246
01:49:58,460 --> 01:49:59,930
The reason why he told me not to run away from him.

1247
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,850
Why I can't run from him.

1248
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:07,500
It explains everything.

1249
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,090
I can't picture colors without you either.

1250

You're one of a kind to me too.

Am I obsessed with you because you're my Probe

01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:16,380
♫ I’ll find wherever you go ♫

1265
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,420
Did you talk to them? Is everything okay?

1266
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:25,670
If I return home today, they'll forget everything without questioning it.

1267
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:27,660
That's great!

1268
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:34,330
Everything worked out smoothly when I told them I was going to quit being a trainee and study with you.

1269
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,470
I guess we'll only be at the library when we go back to Seoul.

1270
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:38,140
Really?

1271
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:40,850
Then, how about we go study after a meal?

1272
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,010
Okay, but I'm not going to study even at the library.

1273
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:45,410
Fine. Let's go.

1274
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:00,370
Auntie! This is my lunch for today! I'm going to eat it with Yoo Han.

1275
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:03,320
Are you playing house with Go Yoo Han with the allowance I'm giving you?

1276
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:06,680
You should know I'm completely against this. I'm going to eat it all. Give me everything.

1277
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,360
What?

1278
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:18,720
Eat slowly. You're going to choke.

1279
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:21,990
Here. It's all yours. It's all yours.

1280
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,580
I'm bitter because you said this is Go Yoo Han's lunch box.

1281
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:30,260
I'm your aunt.

1282
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:33,620
Sorry, sorry. I like you more.

1283
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:38,720
We were able to go back to how it was.

1284
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:04,180
For Yoo Han, who has face blindness (prosopagnosia), and for me, who is color-blind,

1285
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:10,360
to be together and live like other ordinary people,

1286
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:13,390
I'm thankful, and it feels like a miracle.

1287
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:19,720
The gray world I see now contains the excitement that I'll see color very soon.

1288
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:26,810
I don't get why our home room teacher had you (Kim Se Hyun) do this when she could've told Jung Joo Haeng to do it.

1289
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:28,800
I'm Jung Joo Haeng, you brat.

1290
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,210
What are you talking about?

1291
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:34,160
You never unbutton your shirt even in the hottest weather.

1292
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,800
Also, what's with your gypsy style hair?

1293
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,070
Get lost. You can't even recognize your friend.

1294
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:41,940
Alright. Keep up with the good work.

1295
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:49,730
You saw that, right?

1296
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:55,740
It's a secret that everyone in this school knows, but I was wondering if I should tell you or not.

1297
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,960
But I guess you know now.

1298
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,690
Go Yoo Han's secret everybody in this school knows?

1299
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:03,530
He has prosopagnosia which prevents him from recognizing even his childhood friend.

1300
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:07,220
He can't distinguish people apart.

1301
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:11,280
I shouldn't be telling you this.

1302
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:20,830
Hey Min Jae.

1303
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:24,650
2-4-6-7.

1304
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:32,510
The grandpa is only telling you this so Yeon Woo can play hooky.

1305
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:35,470
Please send my thanks to Grandfather.

1306
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:38,900
I'll definitely buy you a red bean jelly bar later.

1307
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,860
- I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.

1308
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,970
Let's go.

1309
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:47,490
Where are they going?

1310
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,890
What is 2467?

1311
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:53,930
The lock combination to the rooftop. We're going on a date right now.

Hello. I called because it was hard to meet you.

are keeping you hidden.
