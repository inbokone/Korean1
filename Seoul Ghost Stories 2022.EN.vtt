URBAN MYTHS

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.800
This is fiction.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.760
Any similarity to persons or events
is coincidental.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.320
Dammit, what now?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.120
Going night fishing?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.360
I'm coming back from it. Something wrong?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.200
Nothing special.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.560
We've been getting reports of
wild animals in the area.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm Officer Park Dong-hoon,
Seorak Police Station.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.960
May I see your license?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.200
Sure.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040
<i>Missing person reported.</i>

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120
<i>Woman in her 20s.</i>

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.400
<i>Missing person reported.</i>

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.880
Did you get hurt while fishing?
Your posture…

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.480
My back aches from sitting too long.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.840
I'm all right.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.360
Fishing so late. Did anything bite?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.000
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.080
Drive safely.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.200
Bumper is dented.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.200
Yes…

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.960
Goddammit!

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.320
<i>Hey! Why don't you pick up?</i>
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.040
<i>Why aren't you back yet?</i>

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
<i>Did you catch a whale?</i>

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.240
Stop nagging…

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.520
I was in an accident…

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.280
<i>Accident? While driving?</i>

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.960
Yeah, I hit a deer or something.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.200
You go to the body shop tomorrow.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.080
<i>Who do I look like?</i>
<i>Your slave or something?</i>

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.720
Christ, just do what I tell you for once!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.880
<i>What did you say?</i>

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.880
Hold on…

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
What the hell?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.320
<i>I've had it with you!</i>

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.600
<i>Don't swear at me!</i>

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.000
Not you, there was something here…

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.760
<i>What? Something there?</i>

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.480
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.440
-Bitch! Shut your hole!
<i>-Did you just swear at me?</i>

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.880
I'm hanging up!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.760
What the…

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.720
Goddamn pig! He touched my car!

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.440
Who did this?

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.720
Shit, I'm seeing things…

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.320
Go, let's just go and dump it.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.200
<i>-You've deviated from the route.</i>
-I'm shit out of luck.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.160
Where do I ditch it?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.880
There you go.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.840
<i>Calculating a new route.</i>

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.440
Shit!

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.720
What's this?

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.280
Why are you doing this to me?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.880
<i>Please go straight until further notice.</i>

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.960
<i>Frequent accident site ahead.</i>

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.320
<i>Speed camera ahead.</i>

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.280
Shut up…

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.200
<i>Drive at 70km/h.</i>

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.000
<i>Speed bump ahead.</i>

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.840
<i>Drive safely.</i>

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.080
<i>Drive safely.</i>

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.720
You stupid bitch!

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.400
Are you messing with me?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.160
Who do you think you are, huh?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.560
Did you curse me?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.040
What do you want me to do, bitch?

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.560
You shouldn't have jumped out like a deer!

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.120
Goddamn!

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.760
HARAN FUNERAL HALL

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.640
Didn't Eun-ji have
a good work life and engaged?

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.360
Baffles me why this happened to her.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.520
Who knows.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.640
I haven't talked to her in five years.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.200
You too, right?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.240
I heard the door to where
she jumped off from was locked.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.840
Which means
she climbed up the wall from the balcony,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.040
and then jumped off.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.120
That's so dumb. She wasn't a climber.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.200
Not sure. She must have been desperate.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.880
You know
depression causes suicidal thoughts.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.800
That's so horrible.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.480
Didn't you come early?
Are there a lot of people?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.520
Most from the 3rd year is here.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.520
Except for Hyun-ju…

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.800
-Hyun-ju…
-I shouldn't have mentioned it.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.800
Hyun-ju?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.680
I couldn't stand
the stench of her hair at the retreat.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.840
Her, right?

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.640
Yeah…

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.440
-Didn't she dress like a bum?
-Right?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.520
Let's not talk about the past.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.840
Enough of gossip,
I gotta go finish unpacking.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.080
Yeah…

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.400
What's with her again?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.160
Yes?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.880
Oh, hello!

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.760
I moved in next door.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.800
Nice to meet you.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.760
You moved in last week, right?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.640
Yes, I did.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.880
I was so busy with unpacking.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.680
Here you go.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.480
It's so pretty!

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.880
Can I ask you a question?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.760
Have you run into a woman in red?

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.480
Woman in red?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.160
Well, she's always in a red dress.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.040
She's always watching me
in the parking lot.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.200
I saw her about three, four times already.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.320
I figured she was just crazy.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.280
I'm not sure…

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.160
I haven't seen anyone
wearing red recently.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.200
I see. Thank you.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.840
DIRECTOR KIM

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920
Yes, director.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.080
<i>Is the presentation progressing well?</i>

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.160
Yes, it is.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.520
<i>I'm counting on you, Su-jin.</i>

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.560
Of course.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.400
DONGLAN GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL
2012

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.600
Could it be Hyun-ju?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.920
No way…

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.400
Excuse me!

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.920
What's wrong with you?

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.240
I've had it.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.520
You know how Eun-ji died?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.760
Tell me in detail.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.600
Detail? That was everything I know.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.280
You said she jumped off the building.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.400
Was she chased by someone?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.720
Chased?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.680
She just went up and jumped.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.160
It's frustrating.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.560
Everyone's jealous about
you having a cushy job.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.800
What's the matter?

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.680
You have no clue.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.960
You don't know how hard
I worked to get here.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.880
Never mind. I'm going back in.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.080
I'm sure there are some
who can't stand us being happy.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.240
You and Eun-ji were especially mean.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.520
What do you mean?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.000
I…

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.920
I'm just blabbering.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.640
<i>The door is closing.</i>

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.440
<i>Third floor.</i>

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.000
<i>Sixth floor.</i>

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.040
<i>Eighth floor.</i>

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.720
No! Please!

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.160
Come on!

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.240
Please!

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.080
No!

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.080
It's me, Su-jin.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.200
Hyun-ju…

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720
<i>You're next.</i>

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.440
<i>You just wait.</i>

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.640
Please call the doctor quickly!

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.360
You must be in a lot of pain.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.080
Please calm down and wait.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.720
All done.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.240
Do you feel a lot of pain?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.720
Yes.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.720
Something's poking me. I'm going nuts.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.520
I'll take a look.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.680
Weird.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.640
I don't see any cavities or swollen gums.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.320
Did that hurt?

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.800
Yes. It's been hurting for a while.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.480
It's not just there,
my head is about to explode too!

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.720
Let's talk it over with the x-ray.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.080
Show him the way.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.200
I'll show you to the doctor's office.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.840
I've never seen such a thing…

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.800
Why is the root area white?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.120
Looks like something is stuck there.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.120
Did you have anything odd to eat?

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.200
No, no, it's not like that.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.520
Did you have nerve problems?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.360
No, never.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.480
All right.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.680
I'll look into this.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.400
Please book a follow up.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.040
Hang in there and take some painkillers.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.160
Okay.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.720
Doctor, I'll head out now.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.640
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.800
What the…

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.040
Why didn't she clean up?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720
What the hell…

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.000
This is a parasite.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.840
I can't believe
I'm seeing parasites in the modern era.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.120
I've never seen parasites so deep inside.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.800
Did the patient seem weird?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.560
He looked perfectly normal.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.000
Yeah?

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.320
Maybe he's into eating weird things.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.760
You know,
the kind that eats dirt and bugs.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.800
I'm not sure.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.240
Haven't you seen anything like this?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.000
It's unheard of in a country
with proper water system.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.560
You might find something in
old research papers.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.880
Go check it out in the library.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.720
"Tooth worm.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.480
As a type of parasite,
it lived near the teeth,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.960
in the form of a parasitic worms.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.680
After spawning near the teeth of the host,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.840
it traveled rapidly
to organs and the brain.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.280
Currently, tooth worms are known to be
completely exterminated.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.040
Kaesong Clinic in 1940,
started by foreign missionaries,

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.240
was presumed to be
the place of first exposure.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.600
According to testimonies,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.200
one might rationally assume that
a secret experiment took place

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.840
in the basement of Kaesong Clinic,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.400
but no solid evidences have been found."

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.120
NURSE CHOI

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.360
Tooth worm found in eye

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.760
Yes?

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.320
<i>Sir, are you coming in…</i>

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.200
You know that patient, the one who was
complaining about gum pains?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.360
<i>Yes.</i>

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.600
When is his appointment?

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.280
<i>One moment.</i>

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.160
<i>It's today.</i>

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.920
Can you delay it?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.440
<i>He said he's only available today.</i>

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.920
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.000
Are you in a lot of pain?

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.840
Nurse Choi.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960
Nurse!

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.040
Ji-eun!

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.040
Hold his head and arms.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280
Hurry, doctor.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.520
Hold him down so I can come!

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.160
He's in a lot of pain. Hurry!

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.280
Come on!

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.840
I don't believe this.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.440
Gloves… Dammit!

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.960
Any family members or
associates with same symptoms?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.200
It's a type of parasite,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.360
but it doesn't appear out of thin air.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.800
We need to know the cause
to prevent recurrence.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.680
Open wide, please.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.320
This is dangerous, so please stay still.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.000
Christ…

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.840
Stay still, you mustn't move!

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.080
Sir, don't move!

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.640
Doctor!

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.000
Doctor!

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.040
Ji-eun!

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.600
Shit!

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.120
Hello? Anyone here?

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.440
Help! Please!

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.920
Help!

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
Ouch!

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.159
Why do you clip it so short?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.159
Stay still, it looks cleaner that way.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.760
Can I really summon your soul
if I keep this?

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.120
Yeah.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.400
It's like playing hide-and-seek.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.120
What if you can't find me?

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.600
I'm really good at it.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.760
I know all your hiding spots.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.800
Let me clip yours.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.880
Ouch.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.600
Careful.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.719
Don't you trust me?

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.360
I know what I'm doing.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.679
I'm so jealous of you.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.440
I want to be like you.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.520
What?

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.960
This mole under your eye,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.120
your eyes…

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.520
and this heart!

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.240
So cheesy.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.040
After I graduate, I'll get a tattoo there.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.680
It'll be a couple tattoo.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:17.920
Right here.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.240
You should do somewhere cuter.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.440
I could get a cuter symbol.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.280
Look.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.960
Tada!

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.640
It's cute.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.040
She probably killed herself.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.800
-Who?
-The lesbian!

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.200
Poor girl.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.680
She's looking at us.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.920
She's overreacting.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.480
So shameless.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.640
<i>Hye-yeon, are you okay?</i>

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.320
<i>Please answer me.</i>

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.200
<i>If one of us dies first,</i>

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.480
<i>the other must fulfill the promise.</i>

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.760
<i>Sorry about what happened to Hye-yeon,</i>

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.320
but you must move on.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.560
Who quits school nowadays?

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.920
Are you even listening?

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.440
Didn't you write a diary with her?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.240
Classmates told me…

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.840
What did they say?

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.160
That Hye-yeon and I were dating?

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.640
Who the hell said that?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.640
Kang Ji-hyun!
This isn't the time to get pissy!

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.880
REHEARSAL ROOM

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.320
No way!

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.240
At least tell me to pose!

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.920
What if I don't look good?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.240
No, you look perfectly nice.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.840
Come on, let's take it together.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.000
Yeah? Should we?

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.000
Just look over there.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.360
One, two, three!

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600
One, two, three!

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.640
I bet we look hot, let's take a look!

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.000
I miss you, Hye-yeon.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.560
<i>If one of us dies first,</i>

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.080
<i>the other must bring back the soul</i>

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.880
<i>through necromancy.</i>

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.040
Smells so nice.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.120
What?

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.320
Your hair.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.080
It's so soft too.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.360
Come on,

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.440
I like your eyes.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.520
You like my hair?

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.280
Yeah! Wanna trade?

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.080
If we do, we'll get jealous again.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.560
It'd be better if we share.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.840
Yeah? Should we do that?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.120
Hye-yeon, I'll bring you back soon.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.880
Kang Ji-hyun is 'it' first.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.240
Ouch!

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.520
Ah!

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.960
What's wrong?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.320
I poked myself…

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.040
What's up with them?

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.200
So nasty.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.200
Are they nuts?

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.640
All out in the open.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.120
Stop it, Hye-yeon…

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.920
They got caught doing that before.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.840
They're crazy.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.040
They're staring. Let's go.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.280
Why do they overreact?

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.240
Kim Hye-yeon is 'it' next.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.080
Count to 100…

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.000
then find me.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.840
Hye-yeon…

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.760
Please…

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.360
Don't…

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.240
Hye-yeon…

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.960
Hye-yeon, is that you?

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.000
Hye-yeon!

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.920
Where did you go?

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.680
Hye-yeon, what went wrong?

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.200
"Rip the doll, put in the clippings,
stitch it with red thread.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.480
Call out the name in front of the doll
three times and count to 10."

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.080
I did it properly.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.320
"The soul that has returned

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.040
must eat the flesh of the living…"

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.480
<i>"In order to live again."</i>

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.160
Hye-yeon, it's me!

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.280
Thanks, Ji-hyun.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.920
We are one, now and forever.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.520
Yeah.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.800
Thanks to you, my back is out
from cleaning up alone all day.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.600
Thanks for not showing up
when you said you would.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.840
<i>You made such big fuss</i>
<i>about living alone for the first time.</i>

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.160
<i>Is everything good there?</i>

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.200
I checked everything when I signed.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.280
<i>Did they clean it before you moved in?</i>

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.200
Yeah.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.240
<i>You got that unit for a real steal.</i>

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.400
As long as there's no weirdo neighbors.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.720
<i>Sorry for not making it.</i>

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.960
Don't worry, come by next week.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.880
Sure.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.080
All right, later.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.680
What was that?

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.240
Come on, on my first day?

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.360
It's okay.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.440
It's all right.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.360
This is too much.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.800
One moment!

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.640
Thank you.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.960
Do you live in 1603?

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.360
Yes…

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.520
Didn't you move in yesterday?

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.760
Yes, yesterday.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.600
I'm next door. Nice to meet you.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.360
Last night, did you…

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.920
Pardon?

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.240
It's nothing.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.120
Welcome to the neighborhood.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.400
Let me know if you have any questions.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.040
Will do.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.480
<i>First floor.</i>

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.640
<i>-The door is closing.</i>
-Hold on.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.960
Your…

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.480
I saw her in the elevator,
and she's too friendly.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.000
She welcomed me and
told me to ask her questions.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.360
You got a chance
if she struck up the chat.

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.440
Didn't you say she was loud at night?

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.840
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:40.000
It was nice to meet you
in the elevator earlier.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.320
You're making noises
to make me nuts, right?

00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.800
Yes.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.720
No.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.360
Have you lived here long?

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.640
Isn't the security guard here
a bit cranky?

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.280
So annoying.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.400
I don't mean to be so forward,

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.400
but do you want to go
have dinner some time?

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.720
I shouldn't have said that.
Please forget about it.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.640
How about dinner this Friday?

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240
That's a yes, right?

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.160
I'll find a really good place.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.120
Let's meet out front after work on Friday.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.240
Hello?

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.200
What the…

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.400
Playing hard to get?

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.640
-Hello.
-Good morning.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.680
You're off to work early.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.120
I'm the hot shot of my company.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.120
You look the part.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.680
I was just joking.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:45.720
So today is Friday. Do you work late?

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.720
No, I get off early.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.120
Me too.

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.200
Is that so?

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.600
You know…

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.520
Sorry?

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.440
You know the knock?

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.240
Okay.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.280
10:26
FRIDAY, SEP 23RD

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:09.040
I was waiting outside. Is something wrong?

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.720
Sorry for pushing you too hard.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.360
How about some music?

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.960
There's some silver lining
to having thin walls.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.160
<i>You dropped this a few days ago.</i>

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.720
<i>I kept it with me.</i>

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.040
<i>I wanted to return it to you.</i>

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.080
Hello?

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.920
Hello?

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.760
REMINDER

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.520
MISSING NEWLYWEDS' CASE?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.120
<i>Kim, 30's, known to be living in the unit</i>
<i>and the prime suspect,</i>

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.400
<i>has gone missing</i>
<i>after the bodies were found.</i>

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.920
<i>Next story.</i>

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.120
A closet would be perfect…

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.920
Anything on Thrift app?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.280
Closet…

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.800
Eh?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.120
This one's nice.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.400
Hello, I saw your ad on Thrift.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.240
Yes, the closet.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.280
In-person deal?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.720
Is that okay with furniture?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.360
Sure, I'll come by tonight.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.400
Hello.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.240
Are you the closet owner?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.800
Yes, hello.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.560
I was going to…

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
pay someone to bring it down,
but it's not easy.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:19.920
I see.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.800
Since you're a woman,
it'd be improper to invite you in.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.240
Sorry?

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.240
How about just looking at the pictures?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.400
I'll hire someone to deliver it tomorrow.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.760
If you're nearby, may I take a quick peek?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.840
It's really all right.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.040
Are you sure?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.080
Sure, I should inspect it in person.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.840
Okay, come in.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.480
It's in the room.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.120
It's pretty nice.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.400
It looks expensive.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.160
Are you sure it's free?

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.400
I had it custom-made three months ago.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.880
But it didn't fit, so I couldn't use it.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.040
The material is really different.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.360
The design's very antique.
You have good taste.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.320
Yes, well…

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.120
I'll call the delivery truck.
Tomorrow works.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.440
No, I can call it.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.200
My friend runs a delivery service.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.960
I feel bad for today, that's why.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.920
-Still, I should--
-Really, it's all right.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.040
Okay then… Thank you.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.840
I'll send it tomorrow at 2:00.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.880
Okay, thank you!

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.480
Here it comes.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.480
I've seen this closet.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.640
It was on Thrift, that weird guy.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.160
How did you know?

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.480
I called about it last month, I think.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.120
He said it was taken.
But he gave it to you?

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.760
I got a way with words.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.760
Did you try to lowball him?

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.480
That's why.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:35.640
What's wrong with this?

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.760
No wonder it was free.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.960
Sleep paralysis.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.120
No way.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.760
It really was a ghost.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.240
On the day you got the closet?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.120
I read it online.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.880
If you get a used closet, you have to use

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.280
red bean bag to get rid of bad luck.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.480
Red bean?

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.960
<i>Yes. It's not hard, give it a try.</i>

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.080
It's not haunted.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.040
Goddamn you!

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.040
You bitch!

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.360
Dammit!

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.000
Where are you going?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.840
Open the door!

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.080
Piss off, I'm calling the police!

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.120
Open up!

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.000
Open the door!

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.280
I'm at Shinsung Villa
in front of Shin-il Univ.!

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.440
There's an intruder. Please hurry!

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.160
Open up! You wanna die?

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.040
I'll see you soon.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.960
Son of a bitch…

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.160
Wait till I get you…

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.000
Hello,

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.040
I am AL Group applicant Jung Jae-hoon.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.000
I majored in Business Administration and
Economics in college…

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.880
That's enough of your introduction.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.480
It's all written here.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.400
Don't think too hard.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.960
We want to know more about you,

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.480
so, no pressure.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.160
You have good people skills
and speak eloquently.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.120
Oh yeah.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.360
What time were you born?

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.520
I was told it's 6:00 AM.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.360
6:00 AM…

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.440
Can you write your name in Chinese script?

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.640
A lot of people speak English
but lack common knowledge.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.120
I see…

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.960
Of course.
I'm certified in Chinese writing.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.880
Then…

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.360
could you write it here?

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.480
Good job.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.120
Why would the head of HR interview you?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.040
I didn't have to do it.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.560
Yeah, well…

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.560
Hey, do you think

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.160
she's interested in me?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.040
Sure…

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.720
Did you spike your drink?

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.760
Honestly, there's no way

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.560
I'd get an interview at your company
with my qualifications.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.480
True…

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.280
That must be it.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.920
She interviewed me for personal reasons…

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.560
Maybe she wanted me to write my details

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.480
to see if we are compatible.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.720
Which pen did you write that with?

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.480
A red pen.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.720
Why?

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.400
It's ominous.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.520
There was a weird rumor.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.160
Our chairman's daughter
died in an accident.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.800
Since then, a shaman has become
the family's confidant.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.760
Whatever the reason,
I'd be glad to be hired.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.480
I'll treat you handsomely if I get in.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.080
Punk…

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.680
This late?

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.720
Congratulations on passing…

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.240
Wow… That's wild…

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.240
I really passed?

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.240
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.520
I'm Jung Jae-hoon,
I'll be joining the marketing team.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.640
Okay, that's your station.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.240
There's nothing urgent for now,
so get a feel of the work.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.320
Okay.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.280
Hello, hello.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.400
Ouch!

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.000
Hold it higher than your heart.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.000
Sorry… I mean, thank you.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.720
I'll wash it for you.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.760
You don't have work, right?

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.440
I'll give you something.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.080
Bring the files on this list
from the archives.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.680
Final candidate?

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.320
Time of Birth: 11:15, 12:30…

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.600
Jung Jae-hoon: All Conditions met

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.920
Jae-hoon?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.120
How's it going?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.920
If you have everything,
bring them upstairs.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.360
Pardon?

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.120
Not yet…

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.880
I'm almost done.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.760
Then, finish up.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.120
Okay.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.280
Early tomorrow morning, right?

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.240
All preparations are done.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.360
Then I'll bring her there.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.840
You have no doubts about him?

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.520
No issues.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.320
I'm not your girlfriend.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.840
Will you stop calling me?

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.440
<i>Where are you now?</i>

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.760
Home.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.320
I had a drink with the study group.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.240
What is it?

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.960
<i>I saw something at the office.</i>

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.480
<i>That head of HR feels off.</i>

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.800
I told you she was weird.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.120
No!

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.920
Not that kind of weird…

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.560
Something's not right, just be careful.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.680
You got it?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.320
Wait a sec.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.160
Left food in the fridge.
Clean up once in a while.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.440
Come on, Mom…

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.400
I'll call you later.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.840
Hello?

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160
Hey!

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.200
She really didn't have to…

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.800
I beg of you… I beg of you…

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.160
I beg of you.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.040
I beg of you.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.400
I am a beauty influencer.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.480
You can make a living with your face.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.960
Since your skin tone is light,

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.440
beige or pink might look better on you.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.280
See what I mean?

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.280
Yes, it's good.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.840
This is part of our promotion
and you get 30% discount.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.840
The other product I showed you earlier

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.800
is $59 after 15% off.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.320
It looks a little puffy.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.080
It's because we sampled a little bit…

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.360
I'm going to look around.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.560
What if a customer sees you?

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.120
Make-up can't help girls
who look like that.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.280
I don't even want to sell it to her.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.640
It feels like I'm scamming her.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.680
That's why she's at least trying.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.240
The manager might see you and fire you.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.880
Hey.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.760
I get paid enough from sponsors.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.160
Working here is just a hobby.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.040
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.440
Bitch…

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.040
With more than 50,000 followers…

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.480
Shit, can't even get one sponsor.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.160
Sweetie!

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.040
-I got accepted just now.
<i>-Hyun-ju, are you going to take it?</i>

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.800
I thought I failed the interview
but I got it!

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.080
Okay, see you in a bit!

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.160
<i>She's ignoring you.</i>

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.920
<i>Don't hold back, just kill her.</i>

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.640
<i>So much filter.</i>

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.880
<i>Stop being a hooker and fix your face.</i>

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.800
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.440
<i>Piss off.</i>

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.400
Yes, manager.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.960
<i>So many bitches today.</i>

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.840
Project was a success, thanks to you.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.760
Yes, see you tomorrow.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.520
Sorry.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.720
<i>Had so many surgeries on her face,</i>

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.000
<i>nothing is her own.</i>

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.160
Noisy bitch.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.400
<i>Hyun-ju, you're the prettiest…</i>

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.920
<i>Hyun-ju!</i>

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.920
Hyun-ju, will you take long?

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.720
A bit.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.400
Mom, give me some money for a nose filler.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.120
Are you insane? Do it with your own money!

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.400
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.800
Why is she always begging for money?

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.360
She's driving me up the wall!

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760
What's wrong with her?

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.960
Then stop talking to me, you broke-ass.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.920
1 LIKE

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.880
That's all I get for spending
all that money?

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.720
Annoying.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.480
Annoying.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.440
Annoying.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.920
Annoying, annoying, annoying, shit!

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.720
<i>You're so pretty now, Hyun-ju.</i>

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.000
<i>Your eyes, nose, lips…</i>

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.760
<i>All so pretty.</i>

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.240
<i>Let's take more selfies.</i>

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.280
Dude.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.680
You wanna hear a scary story?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.120
You know I hate scary stories.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.160
Sometimes, when you move these around,

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.520
the count doesn't match.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.040
What's scary about that?

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.840
Short count isn't the problem,
it's when there's more.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.280
It doesn't make sense.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.240
You can misplace some,
but why do you have more?

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.360
It's because some other form has come in.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.120
No way, how could you not tell
it's not a mannequin?

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.320
Don't you know the mannequin urban legend?

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:13.360
The story about how the skin
looks like a mannequin.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.480
Witnesses wrote on forums for years,

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.160
no one knows who though.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.080
-Boo!
-Holy shit!

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.360
Dumbass.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.840
What the hell is this?

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.200
You're so chicken shit.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.720
This freaked you out?

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.360
It's from the yoga clothing shop,
that's a yoga pose, idiot.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.440
What kind of pose is that?
Your arms will break.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.480
I didn't notice a mannequin
like that earlier.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.960
No?

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.040
Eighty-four including
the one you just moved.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:56.600
Remaining is 2, 4, 6, 8… 10.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.760
Sixteen. Dammit, that's 100 exactly.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.920
Whatever.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.360
Where did you go?

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.560
Who said you're free to go?

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.800
Do I sound like a joke to you?

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.800
What the hell…

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.360
Mannequin urban legend

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.960
Mannequin human urban legend

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.920
"Don't make eye contact with
mannequin human.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.720
Walk away calmly."

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.120
Man…

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.840
Dude.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.440
What's up?

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.360
What you said yesterday.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.560
What?

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.680
Mannequin?

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.400
Idiot.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.560
Did you really count more than the list?

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.760
For sure.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.360
What did you do?

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.360
What else? I threw it out.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.280
Who takes those?

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.800
Who knows. It was gone the next day.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.320
Isn't it freaky?

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.480
Dammit…

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.760
Moron.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.360
Eh? We're short one.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.440
We moved them properly.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.840
Count again.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.920
It's the third time counting it.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.080
You're freaking me out.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.680
Damn.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.000
Forget it, let's call it a night.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.840
We can just go?

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.560
What else can we do?
Why don't you make one?

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.160
Holy shit!

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.840
Dammit!

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.240
Why is this here?

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.840
We moved it yesterday for sure!

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.040
Let's get out of here!

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.240
Shit!

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.120
<i>Don't you know the mannequin urban legend?</i>

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:31.040
<i>The story about</i>
<i>how the skin looks like a mannequin.</i>

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.240
<i>Don't make eye contact</i>

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.120
<i>Walk away calmly.</i>

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:26.440
Shit!

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.680
What the hell?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.120
Just to my liking.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.960
<i>It's exactly 100, asshole.</i>

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.560
Is this the one?

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.080
Yeah, I think so.

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.440
What's this?

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:25.840
Got it!

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.360
Shit, we set a new record!

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.040
Made it in 10 minutes!

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.440
Booya!

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.840
Thanks to whom?

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.480
Thanks to us!

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.240
Us! Us!

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.680

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.840
A new message from Theroomescape

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.480
-Check this out.
-Huh?

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.720
Offer for a sponsored run with
The Room Escape.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.200

the most realistic game.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.880
Gonna do it?

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.400
Of course.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.840
-Go go?
-Yeah!

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.280
Is this the place?

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.000
Definitely feels like a scam.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.160
How could they run a business here?

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.400
Hey, over there.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.240
<i>Thank you for accepting the offer.</i>

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.400
MISSING PERSON

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.440
<i>The payment will be made</i>
<i>once you escape from here.</i>

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.520
The setting here is amazing.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.720
<i>The whole facility is horror-themed.</i>

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.280
<i>It's a Satanic temple.</i>

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:07.120
How much are we doing this for?

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.760
$10,000.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.840
For real?

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.120
How many times do we…

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.840
Shut up.

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.800
Just so you know, our pay is per game.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.320
You three are well-known as
escape room influencers.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.840
-How much?
-$10,000.

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.120
$10,000?

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.400
Also, there is no time limit.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.080
Go ahead.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.960
Come here.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.400
Look at this.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.720
<i>Flipped star symbolizes me,</i>

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.680
<i>follow the mark and open the door</i>
<i>to which you will devote.</i>

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.880
<i>If you wish to stand next to me,</i>
<i>the devil,</i>

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.200
<i>prove with greed and betrayal.</i>

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.720
<i>I, Baphomet,</i>
<i>will stand on sinners who sacrifice.</i>

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.240
So detailed.

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.560
Guys.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.240
I think I got something.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.800
Oh, wow.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.560
Shit! It looks so real. What the hell?

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.720
You scared me.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.120
This is so tacky.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.120
-Let's go.
-Dammit.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.080
Let's split up, I'll go left.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.000
I'll go this way.

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.680
Follow the clues, guys!

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.840
Damn.

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.840
Guys, I found a door!

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.200
Right, right, right,

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.720
right, left,

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.920
right, left.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.400
Then it's left again.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.120
They're both pentagon-shaped.

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.040
Hey! I got something.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.080
Young-min, get over here!

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.000
What do you mean? I got the key already.

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.200
What's with this?

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:39.840
Young-min!

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.760
Dammit.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.320
Are you all right?

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.000
Let's quit this game.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.480
It's all good. This is for $10,000.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.080
How can we quit?

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.000
Didn't you find another door?

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.520
You're nuts.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.760
Crazy.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.240
Shit.

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.720
It was upside down, idiot.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.440
That's why it didn't open.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.240
Seri, come here.

01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:57.560
What is this?

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.480
-Hey.
-Yeah?

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.000
Do you hear that?

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.360
It sounds like bugs.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.160
Nu-ri, there's a button here.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.880
I don't think this is it.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.400
Hey! Don't touch that!

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.320
Hey!

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.320
I told you not to touch it!

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.920
We didn't know!

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.480
Are you kidding me?

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.360
I think it's real! Get us out of here!

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.240
Nu-ri, hurry!

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.560
Why didn't you just listen?

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.840
Do something! Come on!

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.120
Do something!

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:22.560
<i>The faces were looking</i>
<i>either left or right.</i>

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.160
The arrow patterns.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:44.240
Right, right, right… right,

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.160
left, right,

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.440
left…

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.280
Did you find something?

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.800
Yeah.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.760
I think so.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.480
Hold on.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:23.000
It's the same as before.

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:25.360
It's upside down.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.080
Then go find something else!

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.400
All right.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.760
Where are you going?

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.920
This isn't our first rodeo.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.960
There must be a clue in the next room.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.840
Just hang in there.

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.160
Hurry back!

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.120
<i>Why should I share $10,000 with you two?</i>

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.040
Why is it so dark in here?
