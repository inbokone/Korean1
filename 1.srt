1
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Why do you look so cool today?

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Of course, I'm cool

3
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Don’t you know who I am?

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
I’m a Tiger

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Didn’t you notice my hair?

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,500
Your hair color…

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
What the fuck is this color?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Don’t you know?

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
“BLACKPINK in Your Area!”

10
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,100
BLACKPINK?

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes!

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will tell you this

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,200
Lisa is my idol

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know her too?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Amazing

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm amazing

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
I finished changing

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Wait for me too!

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
You’re so slow

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,700
I think I’m getting fat

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
I need to lose some weight

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,000
What about…

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your wife?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Fuck you

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,500
What?

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Who is his wife?

27
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
I’m his husband

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Really?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But yesterday I saw...

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,000
What did you see?

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,000
I saw…

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
I saw…

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Don’t listen to this pink hair dude

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What should we eat today?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Let’s eat…

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
BBQ

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
BBQ?

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
It will make us smelly

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
I just told him that I want to lose weight

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You seriously want to eat BBQ?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So…you don’t want to eat?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can go with Sorn

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just the two of us

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Just the two of you?

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,500
You’re crossing the line now

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Let’s go eat then

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Come

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Don’t forget your shoes

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Quick!

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,500
I’m hungry!

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Hurry!

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I’m hungry

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Quick!

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Wish! Calm down!

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
We will trip

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I’m hungry

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Right

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Don’t you have exam?

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Even though he has exam, he still has to eat

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
So, he can have the energy to study

62
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
He’s right

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
People said “BBQ heals everything”

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Wish, where is Two?

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Normally you guys are always together

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,500
If he come with us, he will complain

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
It’s smelly

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
It’s hot

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,500
So annoying

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Also

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The promotion is “Come 3 Pay 2”

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How are we going to pay if there are 4 people?

73
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I don’t want to solve that issue

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,000
I’m hungry!

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
I know you’re my boyfriend already

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,700
But I still want to drive for you

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Noh!

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You’re showing off your new guitar

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait…Don’t you need to go back and gain more fans today?

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,300
Shit!

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I forgot!

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Damn it!

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just go now

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I’m leaving first then

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
See you!

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who the hell are you honking the horn at?

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At you

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
You were gone for such a long time

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I thought you were dead in front of your calculator already

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Why calculator?

92
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Because

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
You’re Economics student

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,700
All you do is maths stuff

95
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,800
You probably have no interest in anything else

96
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
But…

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I’m interested in you

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop it

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
I miss you

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No need to miss me

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
I haven’t seen you for a long time

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let’s go eat something nice together

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to apologize that I couldn’t come to see you that often

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How about…

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
BBQ

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really?

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,300
Or

108
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,400
If you’re worried that your hair will smell bad

109
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
I can go by myself

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
See you

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It’s okay

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wherever you go, I will go too

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I’m going

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Don’t follow me

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Drive faster. I’m hungry

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Where…

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Look at the map

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Shit

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Here

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Go straight

121
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
At the intersection

122
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Look at the road too

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Turn left at the intersection

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The restaurant is on the left side

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I’m starving to death

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I’m freaking hungry too

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Can you drive faster?

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Break!

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Shit!

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
What the fuck?

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I’m sorry

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You just say sorry and that’s it?

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
Noh, calm down

134
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,000
You almost hit us with your car. This is serious

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,700
Calm down

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,250
My friend already said sorry

137
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,250
Do you want him to bow on his knees asking for forgiveness?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Are you messing with me?

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I dare you. If you mess with me, I will mess with you too

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Fair game

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You drive like this

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Do you even have a driving license?

143
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Are you a police officer? Why are you inspecting my friend?

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Don’t fight

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you hurt?

146
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It’s okay

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let’s take him to the hospital first

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let’s talk about this later

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
What if they run away?

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I won’t

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,700
Please

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It’s done

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,300
Nothing serious. just a bruise

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,000
I asked a nurse for a hot pack

156
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,300
You can’t do that

157
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,600
Using hot pack will make your bruise even worse

158
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
It will dilate your blood vessels

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,700
Within 24-48 hours, you can use cold pack to constrict your blood vessels

160
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,500
It will help to reduce swelling

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So stupid. Who the hell use hot pack?

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
“So stupid. Who the hell use hot pack?”

163
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,200
After 48 hours, you can use hot pack

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sorry for breaking your friend’s guitar and wasting your time

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,500
It’s okay

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
At least your friend is okay

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello Doctor

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hi Phun

170
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you sick?

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh, no

172
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
I got into a car crash

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
I take him to heal the wound

174
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I thought something is wrong with you

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I haven’t seen you for a while

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,300
I’m still around. It’s just that I got so much work to do

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It’s about work or about your boyfriend

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Work, of course

179
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you going to help me with the tutoring camp?

180
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
I don’t think so. I don’t think I can handle it

181
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Why not?

182
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,800
You helped me only a couple of years and now you just ditched me

183
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
I’ll see you later then

184
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay

185
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,800
I have to prepare myself for the night shift

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
See you

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,700
Your friend?

188
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
No. He is a senior that I know from the tutoring camp

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He doesn’t look like a doctor

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He looks like a model

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A prom king

192
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
He has good body shape

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That’s true

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He’s tall

195
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
How are you?

196
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Drink this. It will make you feel better

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
You always ditch me when you have your wife

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Asshole

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,500
Mouth like him…

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Not that nice to have him around

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What did you just say?

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Did you get your medicine?

204
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,000
Not yet

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I’ll get it for you. Wait for me here

206
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,000
Noh

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,500
What are you going to do about your guitar?

208
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
I will borrow a new one from my junior first

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Now is an exam period too

210
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,000
What a bad timing

211
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,000
It’s okay

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You’re an awesome guitarist

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can do it

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Phun!

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I have to go back and gain more likes from the fans

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let’s go

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Get well soon

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can I have your contact?

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
I want to repay for the guitar

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Give him your number

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I give him your number

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Damn you

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
What the hell?

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Does it hurt?

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Not much

227
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
It’s okay

228
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

229
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
You will get well soon

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
I did a magic trick already

231
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
What the magic ?

232
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,500
I will tell you this

233
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
When my little sister gets hurt

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I also do this

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And she said she doesn’t feel hurt anymore

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Pin…

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It still hurts

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Stop acting like my sister

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,500
You cannot be my sister

240
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Why?

241
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
You can only be my boyfriend

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What’s wrong?

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Does it hurt?

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
How many times did I hurt you already?

245
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,000
This time I drove for you…

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
You got hurt because of me

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I’m sorry

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It’s okay

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
As long as you’re beside me

250
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I will be okay

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Can I stay with you the whole night?

253
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,000
No way

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We will stay up whole night

255
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Whole night?

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I didn’t hug you for three days already

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Stop it

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,700
Just one night

259
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
I have exams

260
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Just one night

261
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,000
I have exams

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Just one night

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No way

264
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Fine!

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Well

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
I’m leaving then

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Before…

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I cannot stop myself

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Just go back home

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,500
See you

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Good night

272
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
(Hello Noh)

273
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
(I’m Sorn. The person who hit you by a car today)

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
(Thank you about today)

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
(Hello)

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
(It’s okay. Just get a rest)

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
(I am truly sorry. I broke your guitar too. Sorry about that. Is there anything that I can do to repay?)

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
(Help me click the like button. Vote and share it too. If I win, I can get a voucher to buy a new guitar. I will forgive you then)

279
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Pin’s Birthday

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Calm down, Tiger

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You’re awesome! Hope you win the first place. Help me share this :)

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Sorn

283
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
What’s up, Pin?

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
I don’t have practice today

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Let’s go find something to eat

286
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I…

287
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
I’m sorry

288
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
I’m not free

289
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,500
But I come to find you right away

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,300
I have a test so I have to go back and study

291
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Later then

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
See you

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I’m off

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You’re here

295
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Sorry for bothering

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Here

297
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,000
I have to tell you first

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
I’m very strict

299
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,000
Let’s start

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,500
We will begin with the simple chord

301
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Chord C

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
Put your index finger here

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Your middle finger here

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Your ring finger here

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Put your finger here at the edge

306
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Try to play it

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I told you. Put your finger at the edge, right here

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Move it here

309
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Try to do it again

310
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Again

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,500
That’s it for today

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you alright?

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Your fingers are red already

315
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don’t have that much time left

317
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Is there something wrong?

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Nothing

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Just…

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Just thinking about the past

321
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,000
Phun asked me to teach him to play guitar as well

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
He said exactly the same thing as you

323
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,200
He couldn't even play properly

324
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
He already gave up

325
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Do you think you can do it?

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can do it

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have a lot of patience

328
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Then keep practicing

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Okay

330
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
(Long way to go)

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
(Long way to go too)

332
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
How come you’re here?

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
Have you…

334
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Seen Sorn?

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,500
If he's hiding, how can I see him?

336
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
Fuck you. Stop fooling around

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Calm down. I’m just joking

338
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
If you can’t find him

339
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,500
Who else can?

340
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,700
But you guys are in the same faculty

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,300
You must know

342
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,000
Are you crazy?

343
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Who knows where he is?

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Sorn!

345
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Come here

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,500
What is it?

347
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Why are you hiding?

348
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,000
You have to help me get out of here first

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Huh?

350
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,500
You can just walk out

351
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I don’t want Pin to see me

352
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,000
Whatever is going on between you two. You two can talk it out

353
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Just help me first

354
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will take you to eat BBQ

355
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Fine. I’ll help you

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Since you’re going to take me to eat BBQ

357
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I’m not greedy or anything

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Well…

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,300
Stomach ache

360
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,500
I’m dying!!!

361
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Stomach ache!

362
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,150
I'm dying

363
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What's wrong?

364
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Stomach ache

365
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,800
Look at me

366
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,800
What’s wrong with your eyes

367
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are blinking that much?

368
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
My stomach hurts

369
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
What’s wrong

370
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Let’s go to the nurse

371
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,300
Two

372
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,000
Pin

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,800
I think…

374
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,800
I just want to poo

375
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Well

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
I will go to poo first

377
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,000
See you

378
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What the hell?

379
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He wants to poo?

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,700
I thought he was giving birth

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I smell something

382
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Are we talking about the same smell?

383
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Trust me

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait

385
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
We can’t be sure. Let’s try to test the smell again

386
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,500
One. Two. Three

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
You asked me to betray my friend

388
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
And you took me here to see Noh?

389
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Why are you taking a foul-mouthed person here?

390
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Stop fighting

391
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I ask Noh to teach me how to play guitar

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Nothing more

393
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I don’t trust you

394
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Why are you being so sneaky about this?

395
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,500
I want to play guitar to surprise him on his birthday

396
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Surprise?

397
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Oh

398
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I got it now

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Since you already know it

400
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Don’t tell him about this

401
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Don’t ruin my plan

402
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Trust me

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I won’t tell him

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
You’re such a foul-mouthed

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
How long can you keep the secret?

406
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Watch me

407
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,000
I will help you

408
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,500
Did you lose your boyfriend again?

409
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,500
Right

410
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I have a question

411
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Do you guys have so many tests these days?

412
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,500
I called Sorn

413
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,200
He didn’t pick up

414
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I texted him

415
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
He didn’t reply

416
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Are you worried that he will have someone else?

417
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I’m not worried

418
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,500
I trust him

419
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,500
Right, you trust him…

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,500
If you really trust him

421
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
You won’t be sitting here

422
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,300
I think I have to ask Wish about this

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,300
What did they do?

424
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,000
What?

425
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
That’s Wish’s bag

426
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Obviously

427
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So what?

428
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,500
I think I will check on them

429
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
You’re such a hot-tempered

430
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
You dare to go check on them?

431
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Do you even know which room they’re in?

432
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,500
You’re right

433
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,500
I will go now

434
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Sorn told me that he’s in his room already

435
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Wait

436
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Sit

437
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,000
How can you be sure?

438
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,000
Maybe he’s still in that room

439
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,000
What’s the matter, Pin?

440
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,500
Where are you?

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
I’m in my room

442
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I will go to see you then

443
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
See you later

444
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
He’s in his room

445
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,000
Sorn is in his room already

446
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,300
Wish must be in his room too

447
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,000
Noh

448
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
Have you seen my phone?

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Right, this one

450
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,500
Can I have it back?

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What should you do if you want it back?

452
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank you

453
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Thank you, Noh

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,300
Thank you, Noh

455
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay?

456
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
What are you two doing?

457
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What are you doing here?

458
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,500
I should ask you that question

459
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Do I have to tell you everything I do?

460
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,500
Yes

461
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,500
I’m not your slave

462
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I don’t have to tell you everything

463
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,800
Are you guys seeing each other?

464
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Nonsense

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Me and Noh

466
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Did you even use your brain?

467
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
But

468
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,600
I saw you guys were passing the phone to each other

469
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Did you guys even hold hands too?

470
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Why?

471
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,000
You want the phone?

472
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Here’s my phone

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
My wallet too

474
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
You like expensive things, don’t you?

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,800
I give you my bracelet too

476
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
What the hell is wrong with you?

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Take them

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I told you to take all of them back

479
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,000
What’s wrong?

480
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
You think I want to be with you

481
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Because of these things?

482
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,000
Of course, not

483
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I’m happy when I’m with you

484
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I can be myself

485
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
You did this to me

486
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
Do you even think about my feeling?

487
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,000
Do you even care about it?

488
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,000
Wish…

489
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Don’t touch me

490
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You’re so busy these days

491
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Do you have to study a lot?

492
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
I have so many tests

493
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
I’m always tired these days

494
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
Do you have to study that much?

495
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,400
You don’t even have time for us to eat together

496
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah

497
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay

498
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
What did you at the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts?

499
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I have something to give it to Noh

500
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I feel bad about that day

501
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,500
I feel bad that we broke his guitar

502
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,500
I broke it

503
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Not you

504
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
You don’t have feel guilty

505
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But I also feel guilty

506
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
There’s nothing more, right?

507
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Um…

508
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Are you sure?

509
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
You don’t trust me?

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I…

511
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I have only you
