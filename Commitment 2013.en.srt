1
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:03,688
2009, SEOUL

2
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,118
Here, on the house.

3
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,543
Thank you for everything.

4
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,881
I'll miss this.

5
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,562
Do you have a lover in the North?

6
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,565
-Would you like to see?
-Sure.

7
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,781
So pretty!

8
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,494
Not just one lover! You're a greedy man.

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,416
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Sure.

10
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,756
When will you come back to the North?

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,426
Don't be so chatty.
Have your drink and move on.

12
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,856
Please stay healthy.

13
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,902
Go back, forget what's happened

14
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,114
and have a wonderful life.

15
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,493
Go on now!

16
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,850
Li Young-ho! Surrender!

17
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,144
There's no other way!

18
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,439
You've got nowhere to run.

19
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,900
How do you think we found you?

20
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,822
The North has already abandoned you!

21
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,116
Don't make a scene.

22
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,458
Li! What are you doing?

23
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,876
Sniper unit, report.

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,878
Don't move! Freeze!

25
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,006
-Target in range.
-Ready to fire.

26
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,927
Li Young-ho!

27
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,367
YODUK LABOR PRISON CAMP

28
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,681
Reporting, Colonel.

29
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,610
Are you Li Young-ho's son?

30
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,990
How old are you?

31
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,909
Eighteen, sir.

32
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,541
Myung-hoon…

33
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:50,141
An award from our great leader
for the youth movement…

34
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:57,523
If it wasn't for your traitor father,
you'd have gone far.

35
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,527
My father is not a traitor.

36
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,700
Don't get worked up,
I'm not interested in that.

37
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,875
Myung-hoon, would you like to leave here?

38
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,171
Is that possible?

39
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,507
There is a way.

40
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,595
For you and your sister
to leave here alive,

41
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,014
there's just one way.

42
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,266
What is that?

43
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,648
Become an agent.

44
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,836
2 YEARS LATER
2011, SEOUL

45
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,729
Unit 8, Comrade Kim Sun-myung.

46
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,215
Head of Recon Bureau Unit 8,
Kim Sun-myung.

47
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,511
He was sent here in 1992,
and ran a shell company.

48
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,727
These three are known sleeper agents.

49
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,190
All in Unit 8,
and all killed by the same suspect.

50
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,526
The lefty who uses a Tokarev.

51
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,406
This is the CCTV footage.

52
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:19,248
He looks like a skilled assassin
from the North.

53
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,417
"Assassin"?

54
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,422
All the victims were from Unit 8.

55
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,883
They were loyal, but one day,

56
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,261
they were all wiped out by an assassin.

57
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:37,475
It's part of a power struggle
after Kim Jong Il's health deteriorated.

58
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,020
The anti-Republic of Korea
threw the first punch.

59
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>A small drifting boat was rescued</i>
<i>from the Japanese open sea,</i>

60
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,199
<i>and the defectors</i>
<i>reached Incheon Airport today.</i>

61
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:57,078
<i>A group of four men, four women</i>
<i>and two children</i>

62
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,998
<i>received support</i>
<i>from Nagasaki Immigration,</i>

63
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,252
<i>and they all wanted to be in South Korea.</i>

64
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,838
<i>After debriefing their defection route,</i>

65
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,675
<i>they'll receive relocation support…</i>

66
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,051
Name?

67
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,636
Kang Dae-ho.

68
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,929
Age?

69
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,180
Nineteen years old.

70
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,934
Why did you defect?

71
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,103
I wanted to live like a human being.

72
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,399
By yourself? What about your family?

73
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,487
They're all dead.

74
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,619
Please call once a month to check in.

75
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,037
FOSTER CARE AGREEMENT

76
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,542
Dae-ho's quiet and gruff,
but he's a gentle soul.

77
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,171
Please take good care of him.
Thank you again.

78
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,382
We should be thankful.

79
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,846
For Dae-ho and you, could I say a prayer?

80
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,973
Pardon?

81
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,933
Give me your hand.

82
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:07,106
Our dear Lord,
thank you for your generosity.

83
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,276
You've given us…

84
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,615
About 20 years now.

85
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,367
Are you shocked?

86
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,496
I'm sure Dae-ho is your alias.
What's your real name?

87
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,206
Enough!

88
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,541
Who cares?

89
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,253
I am his foster mother after all.
I should know.

90
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,342
I like his reticent personality.

91
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,866
Come in.

92
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,881
Go and rest now.

93
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,091
This way.

94
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,106
This is your room.

95
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,663
You must be tired.

96
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,010
Who'd suspect a teen agent, right?

97
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,014
No good will come from getting involved.

98
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,142
Why?

99
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,521
Will he rob our safe?

100
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,232
Until the package is shipped,
don't leave the house unattended.

101
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,643
Which unit?

102
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,812
Unit 8, Special Ops.

103
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,398
You must be well-trained, then.

104
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,277
There's only one rule here.

105
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,323
Stay out of our business.

106
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,534
Then we won't take an interest
in yours, either.

107
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,996
I was looking forward
to a new family member.

108
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,417
No need for strong words
at our first dinner.

109
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,548
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

110
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,467
Students study really hard here.

111
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,595
From sunrise till midnight.

112
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,267
Are you serious?

113
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,871
Everyone, attention!

114
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,916
We've got a new transfer student.

115
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,168
Introduce yourself.

116
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,922
My name is Kang Dae-ho.
I'm pleased to meet you.

117
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,509
That was dull.

118
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,095
Take that empty seat.

119
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,228
I'm begging you,
don't use cell phones in class.

120
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
-Okay.
-Okay.

121
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,690
Dismissed.

122
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,786
Buddy, get the hell out.

123
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,420
Lee Hye-in, where were you yesterday?

124
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,423
Hye-in, got our money yet?

125
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
Let's do some accounting later.

126
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,722
She's mute again.

127
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,767
She never answers right away.

128
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,645
What do you think?

129
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,025
My heart just stopped.

130
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,902
I'll fucking whup you.

131
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,162
Check out his fierce eyes.

132
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,372
Stand down, boy.

133
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,085
What a piece of work.

134
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,758
He's been working out.

135
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,719
Stand the fuck down, asshole.

136
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,806
Jackpot! Brand-new bills!

137
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,559
So much money!

138
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,772
If you don't want trouble,
keep your mouth shut.

139
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,817
Who's this?

140
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,654
She's cute, who is she?

141
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,490
She looks Chinese, though.

142
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,283
I think this fuck's from Yanbian.

143
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,286
Are you from Yanbian? Korean-Chinese?

144
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,042
Take the wallet and walk away.

145
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,462
What the fuck's this?

146
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,298
You asswipes!

147
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,884
I saw this coming.

148
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,804
Come here. You heard me!

149
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,847
Let's go.

150
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,692
Just my luck.

151
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,908
One, two, three…

152
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,787
Again.

153
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,041
And down.

154
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,681
Once more.

155
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,476
What happened to your face?

156
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,857
Did they hurt you?

157
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,738
Is your name Lee Hye-in?

158
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,031
Yeah.

159
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,075
Why are they bothering you?

160
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,539
No reason at all.

161
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
And down.

162
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,422
I was never here.

163
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,349
What is it?

164
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,477
So, who got caught
playing games during class?

165
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,437
You? Or you?

166
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,814
It's you, then.

167
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,195
I knew you were up to no good!

168
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,324
Those of you who were late today,
raise your hand!

169
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,243
Me!

170
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,915
Don't bother trying to skip cleaning duty.

171
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,042
-Got it?
-Yes!

172
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,711
-Dismissed!
-Dismissed!

173
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,424
Hey, Yanbian!

174
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,636
Hear that? Clean the windows, too.

175
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,430
Spotless.

176
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,432
Don't wanna?

177
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,601
You got a new friend to help you.

178
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,769
I'll kill you if you take off.

179
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,814
Get to it!

180
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,867
<i>This is your mission in the South.</i>

181
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,456
<i>The victims were all sleeper agents</i>
<i>from our unit.</i>

182
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,752
<i>They must have been killed</i>
<i>by an agent from Section 35.</i>

183
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,884
<i>Buk Doo-sung, Section 35's agent.</i>

184
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>First, make contact with our network</i>
<i>and gather the necessary gear.</i>

185
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,599
<i>Find Buk and eliminate him.</i>

186
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,829
Evening!

187
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,251
You have it ready?

188
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,461
I had a great dream.

189
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
I see.

190
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,474
I'd like a cake. No decorations.

191
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,230
There are plenty of candles.

192
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,331
BOXING CLUB

193
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,550
-Who is it?
-Delivery.

194
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,198
Who are you? Who sent you?

195
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,116
Where's Buk Doo-sung?

196
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,327
Never heard of him.

197
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:59,044
One last time, where is Buk?

198
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:03,006
Fuck… If I tell you, you'll let me live?

199
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,218
Okay, wait!

200
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,598
There's a guy who saw him once.

201
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,768
He's a butcher.

202
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,893
Take this!

203
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,229
You're trash.

204
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,064
Total trash.

205
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,232
Clean it up.

206
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,068
Take this, too.

207
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,696
Here it is.

208
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,781
Hurry up!

209
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,916
Move! Clean it up!

210
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,210
Hurry up!

211
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,212
Come on, clean it up!

212
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,258
What's with him?

213
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,847
Yo, Yanbian, you two look good together.

214
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,808
Have fun with her.

215
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,768
Love between a Yanbian and a loner.

216
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,520
Here, there's some more.

217
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,522
They look so good!

218
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:54,743
A, during the zygote's development,
the sex chromosomes do not separate.

219
00:24:54,951 --> 00:25:00,415
Or B, sperm's chromosomes do not separate.

220
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,209
Hey, newbie.

221
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,836
What did I just say?

222
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,714
Solve question 18.

223
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,269
The X chromosome comes from the mother,

224
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,939
and nondisjunction in the father

225
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,191
causes Turner Syndrome.

226
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,361
It is a chromosomal abnormality

227
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,572
in which all or part of
one of the sex chromosomes

228
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,950
is absent or has other abnormalities,

229
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,995
and not caused by
the remaining chromosomes.

230
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:46,336
Since B and D are correct,
5 is the answer.

231
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,298
Right, very good.

232
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,469
Okay, let's move on to question 19.

233
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,390
Check the remaining questions
with the answer sheet.

234
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,432
Okay!

235
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,767
Good work.

236
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,651
Hye-in, let's try together.

237
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,165
Sorry, I thought it was empty.

238
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,086
I was just leaving.

239
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,336
Don't just toss your shoes!

240
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,134
What is it? Move aside.

241
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,182
Yo, loner!

242
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
What are you doing in our practice room?

243
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,147
Did you dance?

244
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,316
She danced!

245
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,948
Can't you see I'm talking to you?

246
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,200
Dance for us.

247
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,495
If you're good, you can use this room.

248
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,206
I heard you danced in middle school.

249
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,419
PHARMACY

250
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,760
-All here.
-All here.

251
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,307
He’s with us, don't worry.

252
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
Go to sleep now.

253
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,270
Who's that?

254
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,480
Son.

255
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,815
Son?

256
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,776
He fell from the sky.

257
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,403
Where are you going at this hour?

258
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,781
Must I report my tasks to you?

259
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,325
You should have said someone was upstairs.

260
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,743
I didn't want to.

261
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,746
Here!

262
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,628
It's a black Grandeur.

263
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,630
This is his license plate.

264
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,258
That's all I know.

265
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,302
Please, don't kill--

266
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,197
Look into the motorcycle first.

267
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,949
Yes, sir.

268
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,746
There's no one here!

269
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,297
Let's go inside.

270
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
Holy shit!

271
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,561
-Good work.
-Nice job, cutie.

272
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,312
No.

273
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,859
That's for my private lessons!

274
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,659
He did it.

275
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,288
It was him!

276
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,876
-Who's that?
-Almost had a heart attack.

277
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,254
You got business with us?

278
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,715
You shit!

279
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,597
Having fun? Think for once.

280
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,368
Go kneel in the hall.

281
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,464
It's him.

282
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,186
When I get my cast off,
I'll make his asshole bleed.

283
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,480
A bucket full, make sure of it.

284
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,482
He fucking deserves to die!

285
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,151
He's no joke, though.

286
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,779
Look.

287
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,322
There!

288
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,794
Do you know where Hye-in works?

289
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,443
What is it?

290
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
I've got a migraine.

291
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,617
Leave early? Sure, you're free to go.

292
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,869
I'll give you a slip.

293
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,710
Why are you looking for Hye-in?

294
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,337
I'm just curious.

295
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,925
I heard she's quitting school
to work somewhere else,

296
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,177
but I don't know the details.

297
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,393
Dae-ho!

298
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,398
It's your uniform.

299
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,447
Been well?

300
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,910
You cut your hair.

301
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,627
Why aren't you coming to school?

302
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,714
I found something I want to do.

303
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,597
I'll be going now.

304
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,892
Dae-ho!

305
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,230
I need a favor.

306
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,071
Okay.

307
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,457
-Hello.
-Afternoon.

308
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,501
-Did you come together?
-Yes.

309
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,422
Big brother!

310
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,344
Come here!

311
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,816
PART-TIME JOB CONSENT FORM

312
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,788
LEE DAE-HO

313
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:11,265
OLDER BROTHER

314
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,479
What's with the rain?

315
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,482
Wait here.

316
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,456
Take this!

317
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,542
Brother, please stop!

318
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,796
Please stop!

319
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,257
Jun-su!

320
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,594
I told you not to bother your sister.

321
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,971
You have to be good!

322
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,855
Shall we?

323
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,074
Come on!

324
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,500
Thank you, big brother.

325
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,630
You like hearing that?

326
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,554
All guys without a sibling
go gaga over that.

327
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,098
I have a sister.

328
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,642
Really?

329
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,478
Same name as you.

330
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,356
How old is she?

331
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,862
Getting too personal?

332
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,780
Fine.

333
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,994
Are you really from Yanbian?

334
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,189
Is there anywhere you want to go?

335
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,610
I never thought of that.

336
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,155
Do you have somewhere in mind?

337
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,910
Somewhere no one knows me.

338
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:42,791
My parents passed away.
No other family, either.

339
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,132
It's okay.

340
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,968
I come here when I miss them.

341
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,640
My dream is in there.

342
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,895
I threw my gum…

343
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,231
and it stuck right here.

344
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,861
I looked it up
and it has a famous dance company.

345
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,284
They express themselves with dance.

346
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,580
Isn't it great?

347
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,418
Wanna try it?

348
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,629
Dance?

349
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,257
No, gum!

350
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,760
Try it.

351
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,680
Come on!

352
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,310
Here.

353
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,445
Do it properly.

354
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,383
Dang it.

355
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,094
Idiot, you should have aimed for Europe.

356
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
You got it in the ocean.

357
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,443
-This is where he lives?
-Yes, sir.

358
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:38,282
It looked like the pharmacy
houses Unit 8's safe.

359
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,204
PHARMACY

360
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,111
What brings you…

361
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:41,136
You know I don't live by loyalty.

362
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,772
Let me live and I'll do anything.

363
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,107
The package.

364
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,530
Master bedroom safe.
The password is "sun prayer."

365
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,200
See? Anything you want.

366
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,077
Holy shit!

367
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,305
If you disrupt this place,
you'll start a war.

368
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,332
I got everything.

369
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,047
Go ahead.

370
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,198
A little young to be a killer.

371
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,247
Here it is.

372
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,668
Madam! Madam, drink with us.

373
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,380
That's enough!

374
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,720
I'm off for the day. Go next door.

375
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,140
The pharmacy's closed.

376
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,394
Yeah?

377
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,814
Then wait a moment.

378
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:16,448
-Madam, goodbye!
-See you!

379
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,587
What a clumsy bastard.

380
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,509
Here.

381
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,804
It's the only place
that bought a Ducati last month.

382
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,598
I'm certain it's this place.

383
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,913
Boss, he looks different.

384
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,623
Isn't it obvious?

385
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,169
These sleeper agents
probably faked their identities.

386
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,964
Check into this.

387
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,175
Okay.

388
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,436
They funneled around $30 million recently.

389
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,272
It all went to the North?

390
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,942
This also has to be
part of the succession power struggle

391
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:37,821
between Unit 8 and Section 35.

392
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:46,371
Write it up, and conclude that
this incident is a gas explosion.

393
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,915
There's one more problem.

394
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,884
What's this?

395
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,137
He was adopted by the deceased.

396
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,032
Look at you.

397
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:28,580
You look like a young noble,
but eat like a dog.

398
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,249
Lieutenant.

399
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,171
-Is it always like this?
-What is?

400
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,214
It's taking…

401
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,718
far longer than I thought.

402
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,969
Look here.

403
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,557
Do you know what my first mission
in three years is?

404
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,271
To feed your sorry ass.

405
00:53:56,691 --> 00:54:00,195
It's only been a month. Wait it out.

406
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,909
Unless they abandon us,

407
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,286
all you can do is be patient.

408
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:16,461
Don't call me "lieutenant."
It's "Granny" to you.

409
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,186
Stop!

410
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,023
Madam!

411
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,944
Doing well?

412
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,405
Hard at work?

413
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,407
Your grandson?

414
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:49,953
Like hell! Come by after work.

415
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,830
Have a drink on me.

416
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,374
Sounds good, I will!

417
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,669
Okay, be careful now!

418
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:10,098
Write "spy" on your forehead,
why don't you?

419
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,642
Idiot.

420
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,276
Come on now, relax.

421
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,030
You can just walk away casually.

422
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,579
How old are you?

423
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,207
Twenty this year.

424
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,004
Any family?

425
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,258
My parents passed away…

426
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,016
and only my sister left.

427
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,143
Is that so?

428
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,855
Isn't she pretty?

429
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,648
Let me see.

430
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:08,031
She looks so beautiful.

431
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,534
She's very energetic.

432
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,961
Is that your father?

433
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,150
PYONGYANG

434
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:55,578
Shouldn't we tighten the noose on 35?

435
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,415
To make our move, we need our funds back.

436
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,962
Don't worry, preparations are under way.

437
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,267
PIANO TUNING

438
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,822
-Mr. Kang Dae-ho?
-Yes.

439
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,852
Why haven't you called?

440
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,022
The situation's complicated here.

441
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,609
The Party decided
to give you a bigger role.

442
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,819
Don't let us down.

443
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:14,240
Remember the incident at the pharmacy?

444
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,244
Don't think too hard. We'll hit them back.

445
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,497
Is Hye-in doing well?

446
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,042
Don't you worry.

447
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:29,547
<i>It's your last mission.</i>
<i>Bring back what was taken.</i>

448
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:34,010
<i>Then you can meet your sister.</i>

449
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,333
<i>Brother.</i>

450
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,837
<i>I heard you'll be back in a few days,</i>

451
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,425
<i>so I'm making this as a present for you.</i>

452
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,636
<i>Myung-hoon…</i>

453
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,181
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

454
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,175
Thank you for coming all this way.

455
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,263
I didn't realize
a liaison officer would come.

456
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,057
It's important enough for me to come.

457
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,350
This way, please.

458
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,190
Please sit here, sir.

459
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,485
The package?

460
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,072
Street value is $30 million.

461
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,117
I organized it for your convenience.

462
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,053
Who the hell--

463
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,349
We've got an intruder!

464
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,683
Sung-hoon!

465
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,357
Go outside and check!

466
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,246
We have to move, sir.

467
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,668
Officer, what about us? Comrade?

468
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,726
Give it to me.

469
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:18,609
Why did they call the meet?
Off the record, too.

470
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,905
They probably want a cover-up,
God damn it.

471
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,242
Let's talk after the Beijing trip.

472
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,861
Good work.

473
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:08,576
It's been a while since someone returned.

474
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,958
What's this?

475
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,422
Well, well, well!

476
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,467
Just look at this tacky color!

477
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,055
I hope to see you back home.

478
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,894
Nonsense. My duty is to be
the backbone of our revolution.

479
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,564
Leave everything behind when you go.

480
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,069
Go back to being a youth.

481
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:48,407
Stay immature as long as possible, got it?

482
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:57,792
I have to get ready. You go on now.

483
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,562
Granny…

484
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,525
please stay healthy.

485
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:29,198
Don't you worry about me. Go on now!

486
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,405
Dae-ho?

487
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,208
What brings you here?

488
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,088
I'm going somewhere.

489
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,176
Where? Far away?

490
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,888
To meet my sister.

491
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,731
That's great.

492
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,657
Keep in touch?

493
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,381
Here for the boat?

494
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,800
Yes.

495
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,719
Come inside first.

496
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,559
BEIJING

497
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,441
Can I trust this intel?

498
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:15,031
We'll take the heat
and hand over all Unit 8 agents,

499
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,657
and you don't want it?

500
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:20,661
This is taking the heat?
More like a slap in the face!

501
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,246
Be quiet.

502
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:23,956
Listen carefully.

503
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:32,214
The era of great ruler Kim Jong-Un
will begin soon.

504
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:37,636
Who did you say was the great ruler?

505
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,724
You'll have to figure out

506
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:46,562
how you'll maintain a relationship
with Section 35.

507
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,453
Did you get the package?

508
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,247
I have it with me.

509
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,834
Where's your home?

510
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,754
Pyongyang, Usungdong.

511
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:19,470
It's five hours to Heju Harbor.
You'll have breakfast at home.

512
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,556
Great.

513
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,357
What the hell?

514
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,860
Sir, must we do this?

515
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,320
<i>Yes!</i>

516
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,947
<i>Do it!</i>

517
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,324
It's a commie sweep job, so why not?

518
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,620
More like cleaning up
after their bitch fight!

519
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,497
<i>It'll still be clean.</i>

520
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,251
Let's say it's a power struggle,
as you said.

521
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,336
If we defuse the situation like this…

522
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,674
This is from the top. Get it done!

523
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,175
<i>Sir!</i>

524
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,640
<i>God damn it.</i>

525
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:39,592
What are you doing?

526
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,809
You're quite naive.

527
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,525
Who ordered you?

528
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,822
Who ordered you?

529
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,909
No agent has ever returned home.

530
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,329
But that doesn't mean you can live here.

531
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,200
Wait!

532
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,869
You look so scary!

533
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,497
Don’t move! Choi Ik-sung!

534
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,791
Spit it out!

535
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,459
BAKERY

536
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,257
Let go of me!

537
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,300
Situation under control.

538
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,477
Motherfucker! Don't move!

539
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:14,937
Don't move!

540
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,021
Granny!

541
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,898
-Go away!
-What are you doing?

542
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,650
Lower your knife, please.

543
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,612
I knew this day would come!

544
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,739
You piece of shit!

545
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:29,243
I've still got some fight in me!

546
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:42,172
Why are you still around?

547
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,676
Get out of here!

548
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,975
-I'll kill you all!
-Don't shoot!

549
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,147
Granny.

550
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:13,579
Go back alive…

551
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,055
Freeze.

552
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,818
Toss the gun.

553
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,830
Kang Dae-ho… I mean, Li Myung-hoon.

554
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,542
Give yourself up. That's the only way.

555
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,796
How do you think we found you?

556
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,299
The North has already abandoned you.

557
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,262
What can you do alone?

558
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,557
Li Myung-hoon?

559
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:28,046
Dae-ho?

560
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,552
Dae-ho! What happened to you?

561
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:35,387
Dae-ho!

562
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,101
Dae-ho.

<i>…Kim Yong-hwan was captured alive,</i>

Dae-ho, are you awake?

573
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,443
Are you okay?

574
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,582
Dae-ho, what's wrong?

575
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,590
I shouldn't have come here.

576
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,890
You can't go like that!

577
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,476
I know you're on the run.

578
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:15,654
You're gonna keep me here…

579
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,784
and call the cops, right?

580
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,579
What are you saying?

581
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,125
You're my friend!

582
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,885
I don't have any friends.

583
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,346
Kang Dae-ho!

584
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,892
You don't even know me.

585
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,612
Tell me!

586
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,822
Where did he go?

587
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,667
Send me to the South.

588
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,544
Say what?

589
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:18,008
I'll bring it back for sure.

590
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:26,308
I was his handler.
I can get in touch with him.

591
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,399
That was quite amusing.

592
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,280
Remember my words.

593
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,450
Wherever you go…

594
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,246
we'll come after you, even in hell.

595
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:57,089
Make sure to kill the son of a bitch

596
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,175
who killed our agents.

597
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,136
How much is this?

598
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,929

Why?

605
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,919
Did something happen?

606
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,089
Could you be frank with me?

607
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:08,136
You got the wrong info.
I don't know him well.

608

The last I saw him was when I left school,
two months ago.

Yeah?

-Myung-hoon!

674
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,007
Li Myung-hoon!

675
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,801
-Drop your gun.
-Help!

676
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,053
You are surrounded.

677
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,347
Drop your gun.

678
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:39,225
Li Myung-hoon, stop!

679
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:51,154
Brother!

680
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,345
I'm also from Pyongyang.

681
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,764
What's your name?

682
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,143
Li Hye-in.

683
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:28,816
<i>I confirmed that she's the sister</i>
<i>of Li Myung-hoon.</i>

684
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:33,404
She was with Unit 8's
Colonel Moon Sang-chul.

685
01:31:38,492 --> 01:31:39,785
We've got a problem.

686
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:29,460
<i>Blood is indeed thicker than water,</i>
<i>you traitor.</i>

687
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:32,380
Why did you bring my sister into this?

688
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,343
What happened?

689
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:42,807
You'll be hunted down
as long as you have that package.

690
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:47,103
<i>Until you and your sister die.</i>

691
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,896
I will kill you.

692
01:32:49,563 --> 01:32:51,899
<i>Sure, you must.</i>

693
01:32:52,566 --> 01:32:56,445
<i>But when you come, bring the package, too.</i>

694
01:32:57,029 --> 01:33:03,744
If you do, I'll let your friend go.

695
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:06,914
What?

696
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:11,794
It's not like you to make friends.

697
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,257
What are you doing?

698
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:20,428
Are you mad?

699
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:21,846
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

700
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:29,854
Before I really get mad,
bring me those diamonds.

701
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:43,576
Isn't it hot with the scarf?

702
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,665
This is for my brother.

703
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:52,209
I made it myself.

704
01:33:53,502 --> 01:33:56,630
Yeah? It's really pretty.

705
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,471
UNKNOWN CALLER

706
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,900
Myung-hoon? Where are you?

707
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,611
Is my sister with you?

708
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,113
<i>Yes, she's here.</i>

709
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:22,615
Let me talk to her.

710
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:34,543
It's your brother.

711
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,423
<i>Myung-hoon?</i>

712
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:41,801
Are you hurt?

713
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:45,137
No, I'm fine.

714
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,768
How about you?

715
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,646
I'm okay.

716
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,317
<i>You must be scared.</i>

717
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:01,278
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

718
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:12,081
Wait a little longer, I'll come for you.

719
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:14,583
You promise?

720
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:22,341
Please come for me soon.

721
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,595
I promise.

722
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,017
Let me talk to him.

723
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,274
<i>Give yourself up.</i>

724
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,485
<i>I know what's happening to you.</i>

725
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,323
<i>Come see your sister.</i>

726
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:50,870
<i>-There's something I must do.</i>
-Myung-hoon.

727
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:58,878
I'll come tomorrow, after it's done.

728
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,372
Hello?

729
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,582
<i>Myung-hoon?</i>

730
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,210
<i>Myung-hoon?</i>

731
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:30,010
Triangulate this call, on the double!

732
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:45,776
I knew this would happen.

733
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,447
Unnecessary emotions
will get you in the end.

734
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:00,499
Where is she?

735
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:43,917
These meaningless stones…

736
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:48,130
you thought I'd keep them?

737
01:38:53,093 --> 01:39:00,017
You're still a child,
a long way from adulthood.

738
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,770
You can't do this to me.

739
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:10,110
I followed all your orders.

740
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:15,282
I wanted to make you our nation's hero.

741
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:20,037
But you…

742
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,001
made me a killer.

743
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:14,633
Are you hurt? Do as I say.

744
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:28,731
Resilient fuck.

745
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:41,869
You okay?

746
01:41:43,972 --> 01:41:45,015
Let's go.

747
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,354
Dae-ho!

748
01:41:51,104 --> 01:41:52,397
Go!

749
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:55,609
Go!

750
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:05,452
Get out of here!

751
01:42:15,712 --> 01:42:17,005
Sir…

752
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:45,576
Motherfucker, my diamonds…

753
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,245
You're finished.

754
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,626
Moon Sang-chul!

755
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,795
Don't move!

756
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:59,214
It's all over!

757
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:03,135
It's far from over!

758
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:09,433
Comrade Li, if you want to live,
shoot him.

759
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:12,477
Myung-hoon, drop your gun.

760
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,867
What can I do?

761
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,623
I can't even go back.

762
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:38,086
This must be the end.

763
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:44,927
Myung-hoon!

764
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,137
Myung-hoon!

765
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,063
I have to go.

766
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:24,609
She's waiting for me.

767
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:39,583
I'm sorry.

768
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,897
You must be Hye-in.

769
01:48:10,066 --> 01:48:13,904
Are you Hye-in, too?

770
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,032
Yeah.

771
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:28,084
Hye-in, wanna take a walk?

772
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:39,846
<i>You said to me once</i>

773
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:44,768
<i>that you wanted to be somewhere</i>
<i>no one knew you.</i>

774
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,520
How do you know my brother?

775
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:50,190
How?

776
01:48:50,273 --> 01:48:53,568
<i>How nice would it be, if I could, too?</i>

777
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:55,445
We were classmates.

778
01:48:57,113 --> 01:49:00,116
My brother and you
went to the same school?

779
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:03,370
<i>I lived here as Kang Dae-ho…</i>

780
01:49:04,579 --> 01:49:09,376
<i>but when I was with you,</i>
<i>I found myself again.</i>

781
01:49:13,421 --> 01:49:15,006
<i>Thank you, Hye-in.</i>

782
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:21,179
<i>My name is Li Myung-hoon.</i>
