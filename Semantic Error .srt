811
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:35,496
That can't be the problem.

812
01:03:35,496 --> 01:03:40,057
How do you know that's not the problem? How can you be so sure?

813
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:41,702
What are you going to do about my pictures?

814
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:43,371
Your computer was broken.

815
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:46,564
But why are the pictures gone? Why did you delete them?

816
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,543
They're gone. Just forget about them.

817
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:51,769
How can I just forget about them? Tell me.

818
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,573
You said you backed up everything important.

819
01:03:55,573 --> 01:03:58,209
I also formatted your hard drive.

820
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,221
So what's the problem?

821
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:03,248
Still, you deleted everything. That's harsh.

822
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:05,950
Computers are like people in a way.

823
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:10,822
If they keep unnecessary things inside, they are bound to break down.

Or slow down at least.

Fine. You did well.

You talk like I'm some kind of a machine.

- No.

I'm not sure. Go away.

- Get lost.
- Damn it.

841

What is this? A new project?

842
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:14,452
No.  Just lately to loosen up my hand.

You.

No, it was a total fiasco.

880
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:48,773
Melodrama.

No way.

You can just pick out the lines you like.

You're going to write the script?

Yeah. I'm in the theater club. I direct sometimes, too.

But your acting is just terrible.

If you're talking about emotional delusions, then, no.

Delusion?

904
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:27,205
Love is nothing but a delusion they propagate so people will reproduce.

It's unbelievable how narrow-minded you are.

Then, what's your definition of dating?

908
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:46,657
It's just the phase that comes before marriage.

You might as well quit asking.

1450
02:00:01,703 --> 02:00:04,339
Why are you making a game, anyway?

1451
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:08,710
With your grades, you can easily land a job without this project.

1452
02:00:09,444 --> 02:00:11,455
Because I like it.

1453
02:00:11,455 --> 02:00:15,016
I didn't know robots could "like" something.

1454

Everybody has the same starting point in games.

1455

They're rewarded for what they do.

1456

What have you done?

1471
02:02:03,525 --> 02:02:05,269
Why don't you get some sleep?

1472
02:02:05,269 --> 02:02:09,197
You're making mistakes because your brain doesn't have active oxygen.

1473
02:02:09,197 --> 02:02:13,000
What a way to say that you're worried.

1474
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,146
I'll sleep for half an hour.

1475
02:02:15,146 --> 02:02:17,772
Don't forget to wake me up. Remember.

1476
02:02:17,772 --> 02:02:21,352
I'll use cold water if I have to, so get some sleep.

1477
02:02:21,352 --> 02:02:23,945
The worst boss ever.

1478
02:03:13,061 --> 02:03:14,905
I thought you said we were just going to have dinner.

1479
02:03:14,905 --> 02:03:17,432
What's dinner without a little drink?

1480
02:03:17,432 --> 02:03:23,137
Thanks to someone, I had to work all night, so I'm craving some alcohol.

1481
02:03:23,137 --> 02:03:25,273
I tried to wake you up.

1482
02:03:25,273 --> 02:03:27,642
You're the one who didn't get up.

1483
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:30,411
Really?

1484
02:03:43,558 --> 02:03:45,359
Senior,

1485
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:49,029
are you asleep?

1486
02:03:57,572 --> 02:03:59,040
Hyung,

1487
02:03:59,774 --> 02:04:01,609
are you asleep?

1488
02:04:04,913 --> 02:04:07,548
You're not joking with me, right?

1489
02:04:08,416 --> 02:04:09,950
Hyung.

1490
02:04:48,423 --> 02:04:51,726
You sure you didn't do anything weird to me when I was sleeping?

1491
02:04:54,596 --> 02:04:57,498
I'm not like you, you know.

1492
02:05:00,668 --> 02:05:04,815
I sent the mail, so you'll probably get a response next week.

1493
02:05:04,815 --> 02:05:07,942
Can I trust you on that?

1494
02:05:13,114 --> 02:05:15,717
Are there any other customers here?

1495
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:19,120
This place is closed today. The owner is out having a good time.

1496
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:21,822
Then we're the only ones here?

1497
02:05:21,822 --> 02:05:23,891
It's nice and quiet, isn't it?

1498

Oh, right. I forgot you didn't drink. Then I'll take…

You're pretty good at drinking.

1501
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,929
I thought you couldn't drink at all.

1502
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:04,131
Well, you know...

1503

I didn't feel like drinking that day.

1504

Then, do you feel like drinking today?

Fine. Try me.

Hey, Jang Jaeyeong.

Yes, Hyung?

You know, you're an idiot, right?

1513
02:07:06,494 --> 02:07:10,798
Of course. I know that better than anybody.

You draw on people's faces. You're nuts.

Man, why did I do that

1517
02:07:19,673 --> 02:07:24,378
to my precious big brother? I'm such a bastard.

1518
02:07:25,913 --> 02:07:29,917
You always follow people around and bother them.

1519
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:34,155
I was going to let it all slide…

1520

- Is that such a problem?

- She always talks about you.

1609
02:15:41,674 --> 02:15:43,687
Like what's your ideal type, what's your dating style,

1610
02:15:43,711 --> 02:15:47,390
and do you confess first. She also said that she likes someone.

1611
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:49,850
It's so frustrating.

1612
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:56,900
What the hell are you talking about? She doesn't like me, okay?

1613
02:15:56,900 --> 02:16:00,170
How do you know that? Unrequited love is always one-sided.

1614
02:16:00,170 --> 02:16:02,696
I know. I know it well.

1615
02:16:02,696 --> 02:16:05,041
Forget it. It's all over.

1616
02:16:05,041 --> 02:16:08,268
She said she'll confess her feelings after the exam.

1617
02:16:09,069 --> 02:16:10,270
"Confess?"

1618
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:13,984
You won't accept her confession, right? You won't, right?

1619
02:16:13,984 --> 02:16:17,243
Think of our friendship—

1620
02:16:17,243 --> 02:16:19,190
You hang me out to dry and still call me a friend?

1621
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:21,450
Forget it. Give me Jihye's number.

1622
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:23,717
- Hyung?
- Now!

1623
02:16:24,818 --> 02:16:27,754
You have to nip things in the bud.

1624
02:16:34,428 --> 02:16:37,831
No matter how many times I drink it, it doesn't get any better.

1625
02:16:37,831 --> 02:16:41,167
Sangwoo's taste is very unique, right?

1626
02:16:41,167 --> 02:16:44,305
He doesn't drink that anymore.

1627
02:16:48,475 --> 02:16:52,610
Hey, Jihye. Do you like me?

1628
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:53,681
What?

1629
02:16:54,982 --> 02:16:59,019
I heard you kept asking Hyeongtak questions about me.

1630
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:04,291
I mean, I was just curious about you.

1631
02:17:04,892 --> 02:17:08,338
- Then don't confess.
- I don't like you.

1632
02:17:08,338 --> 02:17:12,964
But I like someone. Chu Sangwoo.

1633
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:19,449
So just give up already. You know what his response will be anyways.

1634
02:17:19,449 --> 02:17:22,943
"I'm sorry. But I don't want to waste my time."

1635
02:17:25,913 --> 02:17:29,492
Thanks for the advice, but I think this is a little too much.

1636
02:17:29,492 --> 02:17:34,387
It seems like you and I are in similar circumstances, so why should I give up?

1637
02:17:34,387 --> 02:17:36,056
You're right…

1638
02:17:36,657 --> 02:17:39,393
Of course, I understand what you're thinking.

1639
02:17:39,393 --> 02:17:43,029
Chu Sangwoo has everything going for him.

1640
02:17:43,029 --> 02:17:49,102
He's smart, cute, pretty, and has a law-abiding spirit.

1641
02:17:49,102 --> 02:17:52,573
He's probably going to make a lot of money in the future.

1642
02:17:52,573 --> 02:17:54,017
Why is he like this all of a sudden?

1643
02:17:54,017 --> 02:17:56,586
But I'm not thinking of backing away from him.

1644
02:17:56,586 --> 02:18:01,749
If you're thinking about being around him, you have to be ready to go against me.

1645
02:18:02,383 --> 02:18:04,951
Does Sangchoo know that you're like this?

1646
02:18:04,951 --> 02:18:09,223
Of course! We go way back, you know?

1647
02:18:12,092 --> 02:18:17,170
But you know. Why are you acting like we're close?

1648
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:20,810
Also, how dare you call him Sangchoo?

1649
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:24,281
- He said I could.
- Yeah, but I don't like it.

1650
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:26,173
Don't do that.

1651
02:18:26,173 --> 02:18:30,020
If you really have to, call him Mr. Chu.

1652
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:33,580
I'll allow it. "Hey! Mr. Chu!" Like that.

1653
02:18:34,214 --> 02:18:36,149
What?

1654
02:18:36,149 --> 02:18:37,851
"Mr. Chu?"

1655
02:18:51,765 --> 02:18:54,344
And I was just about to start studying.

1656
02:18:54,344 --> 02:18:55,779
Hey, Chu Sangchoo.

1657
02:18:55,779 --> 02:18:59,282
Why are you acting like that? Want me to call Jaeyeong?

1658
02:18:59,282 --> 02:19:01,408
I said I'm fine.

1659
02:19:02,109 --> 02:19:04,144
How irritating…

1660
02:19:05,946 --> 02:19:08,024
Stop acting like a pitiful bastard,

1661
02:19:08,024 --> 02:19:11,852
and ask me anything. I'll tell you everything I know.

1662
02:19:18,225 --> 02:19:22,138
Jaeyeong's past relationships and how long they were.

1663
02:19:22,138 --> 02:19:24,331
Tell me everything you know.

1664
02:19:26,066 --> 02:19:27,977
I hate conversations about dating.

1665
02:19:27,977 --> 02:19:29,638
It's not that.

1666
02:19:29,638 --> 02:19:34,307
I just need past information in order to understand the future.

1667
02:19:34,307 --> 02:19:36,720
It's to measure all variables.

1668
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:38,778
What the hell are you talking about?

1669
02:19:38,778 --> 02:19:42,716
So you want to know about Jaeyeong's love life, right?

1670
02:19:45,552 --> 02:19:48,488
If I have to tell you what I know,

1671
02:19:48,488 --> 02:19:52,259
there's Juyeong, Saebom, and Terry.

1672
02:19:52,259 --> 02:19:55,729
There's the senior from his department he dated when he was a freshman.

1673
02:19:55,729 --> 02:20:00,543
And I also fancied him myself, but I already had a girlfriend back then.

1674
02:20:00,543 --> 02:20:03,246
Then there's the dance major and the flight attendant.

1675
02:20:03,246 --> 02:20:05,739
That's all I know.

1676
02:20:05,739 --> 02:20:09,910
But his relationships didn't last long. And most of the exes were older than him.

1677
02:20:10,811 --> 02:20:12,212
Why did he break up with them?

1678
02:20:12,212 --> 02:20:16,960
Hey, you know how he is. He gets tired of things easily and is often impatient.

1679
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:20,287
I don't think he's very serious when it comes to love.

1680
02:20:21,889 --> 02:20:25,520
Because you like it, let's give it our best...

1681
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,990
together.

1682
02:20:27,594 --> 02:20:33,362
They also said this. He didn't show much affection and was often blunt.

1683
02:20:33,362 --> 02:20:36,970
It just made them feel unwanted.

1684
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:39,672
Really?

1685
02:20:39,672 --> 02:20:42,252
Why? I guess he's not like that around you.

1686
02:20:42,252 --> 02:20:45,712
- I told you it's not like that.
- Okay, okay.

1687
02:20:46,447 --> 02:20:51,151
But I think he's changed.

1688
02:20:51,785 --> 02:20:54,464
An endurance test? He said that's what he's doing right now.

1689
02:20:54,464 --> 02:20:58,568
A guy like him? That means he's going to die soon.

1690
02:20:58,568 --> 02:21:01,871
Hey, you're his friend. Don't you think you're being a little too harsh?

1691
02:21:01,871 --> 02:21:04,932
You got pretty angry for someone who's not in a relationship with him.

1692
02:21:07,501 --> 02:21:13,105
Anyway, I may not know who he really is,

1693
02:21:13,105 --> 02:21:15,408
but he seems serious about it.

1694
02:21:15,408 --> 02:21:20,347
If someone does something he or she has never done before, it must be something special.

1695
02:21:21,648 --> 02:21:24,351
Wouldn't you agree, Chu Sangchoo?

1696
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:27,454
Thank you for giving me the information,

1697
02:21:27,454 --> 02:21:30,824
but please don't change my name like that.

1698
02:21:31,925 --> 02:21:36,797
- How would you feel if I called you Choi Yoochae?
- I like it. I feel like we're close.

1699
02:21:37,464 --> 02:21:41,835
- Then I'll call you Miss Choi Yoochae.
- That's fine by me, Mr. Chu Sangchoo.

1700
02:21:44,171 --> 02:21:46,039
I have a date to go to.

1701
02:21:51,678 --> 02:21:54,281
You're so bad, Jaeyeong.

1702
02:22:00,587 --> 02:22:03,156
Talk about perfect timing!

1703
02:22:03,891 --> 02:22:05,525
Go inside.

1704
02:22:30,617 --> 02:22:34,721
I thought you asked for some time to think. Why are you here?

1705
02:22:34,721 --> 02:22:36,900
I thought we agreed to work on the game together.

1706
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:39,320
It's hard to get a "I missed you" from you.

1707
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:42,090
When are you going to start being honest with me?

1708
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:45,932
Think however you want. It's your choice to be deluded.

1709
02:22:45,932 --> 02:22:48,702
So we first change the rendering, right?

1710
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,863
Why? Does this make me look like a gangster?

1711
02:23:17,864 --> 02:23:19,732
A little.

1712
02:23:22,569 --> 02:23:24,971
Does it have some kind of meaning?

1713
02:23:26,373 --> 02:23:30,076
Not really. I just liked it.

1714
02:23:32,512 --> 02:23:34,614
Want me to draw you one?

1715
02:23:34,614 --> 02:23:36,482
No, thanks.

1716
02:23:39,052 --> 02:23:41,154
Hang on.

1717
02:23:43,724 --> 02:23:46,626
I just thought of one that would fit you.

1718
02:23:54,801 --> 02:23:57,070
What are you drawing?

1719
02:24:00,273 --> 02:24:02,475
Something you like.

1720
02:24:35,442 --> 02:24:39,512
You like it? You keep looking at it.

1721
02:24:41,214 --> 02:24:44,451
It's going to take a while to erase it.

1722
02:24:44,451 --> 02:24:48,889
It took me a while to draw it, so it shouldn't be easy to erase.

1723
02:24:52,125 --> 02:24:53,793
Senior.

1724
02:24:55,729 --> 02:24:57,296
Yeah?

1725
02:24:59,666 --> 02:25:04,470
What can we do during the two-week trial?

1726
02:25:08,075 --> 02:25:11,844
I'm not going to make the decision now.

1727
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:15,615
You get to hold my hand.

1728
02:25:20,487 --> 02:25:22,522
And kissing, we already did.

1729
02:25:39,806 --> 02:25:42,476
The preview ends there.

1730
02:25:43,944 --> 02:25:47,147
How was it? Do you want to purchase the full thing?

1731
02:25:48,215 --> 02:25:49,525
Not really.

1732
02:25:49,525 --> 02:25:51,794
Hey, I could see it on your face that you wanted to buy it.

1733
02:25:51,794 --> 02:25:53,296
- That's not true.
- It is true.

1734
02:25:53,296 --> 02:25:55,755
- Did not.
- Did, too.

1735
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:12,038
If someone does something he or she has never done before, it must be something special.

1736
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,716
Should I try

1737
02:26:23,517 --> 02:26:25,986
for just two weeks?

1738
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:47,140
"I'll announce the results from my analysis."

1739
02:26:50,143 --> 02:26:52,245
Was that a little too formal?

1740
02:26:53,547 --> 02:26:56,582
"I'll accept your proposal."

1741
02:26:56,582 --> 02:26:58,885
"Let's do a trial run together."

1742
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:09,896
That's crazy! Is that really from Dex?

1743
02:27:09,896 --> 02:27:12,999
- Is it real?
-  Just a bit more.

1744
02:27:12,999 --> 02:27:14,477
That hurts, dude.

1745
02:27:14,477 --> 02:27:16,703
- That's crazy!
- I'm so jealous.

1746
02:27:16,703 --> 02:27:18,271
Wow, for real.

1747
02:27:18,271 --> 02:27:20,817
Senior, I have something to tell you.

1748
02:27:20,817 --> 02:27:23,242
You came, Sangwoo?

1749
02:27:23,242 --> 02:27:26,645
Move, dude. He needs to talk to me.

1750
02:27:26,645 --> 02:27:28,548
What is it?

1751
02:27:29,716 --> 02:27:31,317
Well...

1752
02:27:32,752 --> 02:27:35,255
What's going on here?

1753
02:27:36,756 --> 02:27:40,136
[DEX DESIGNER RECRUITMENT ANNOUNCEMENT]
[CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE BEEN ADMITTED!]

1754
02:27:40,136 --> 02:27:43,829
How about it? What do you think about your partner?

1755
02:27:43,829 --> 02:27:45,665
Congratulations, Senior.

1756
02:27:45,665 --> 02:27:47,733
Thanks.

1757
02:27:47,733 --> 02:27:50,871
Are you going to go to France then?

1758
02:28:15,530 --> 02:28:19,632
You, didn't you have something to tell me?

1759
02:28:19,632 --> 02:28:21,568
It's nothing.

1760
02:28:25,372 --> 02:28:27,507
Should I reject the offer from Dex?

1761
02:28:30,644 --> 02:28:32,688
Did you really think it through?

1762
02:28:32,688 --> 02:28:35,048
What is there to think about?

1763
02:28:37,751 --> 02:28:41,387
What? Honestly, if it's not me, it can't be done.

1764
02:28:41,387 --> 02:28:46,292
Just focus on your work. I'll prepare for everything else.

1765
02:28:47,994 --> 02:28:49,762
"Prepare?"

1766
02:28:52,165 --> 02:28:53,967
What will you prepare for?

1767
02:28:54,734 --> 02:28:58,338
If there's no more coffee left, you just have to get some.

1768
02:28:59,572 --> 02:29:01,808
It's something I have to do.

1769
02:29:07,113 --> 02:29:08,981
Hey, Chu Sangwoo.

1770
02:29:17,824 --> 02:29:19,526
Never mind.

1771
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:21,962
It's nothing.

1772
02:29:31,237 --> 02:29:33,506
Cheers!

1773
02:29:33,506 --> 02:29:36,141
- Dude, you're awesome.
- How did you do it?

1774
02:29:36,142 --> 02:29:37,976
Isn't he the first to do it?

1775
02:29:37,976 --> 02:29:42,114
Jaeyeong was always so stylish and irritating.

1776
02:29:42,114 --> 02:29:45,828
Let's take a few photos together before you leave, Hyung. I want to brag on my Instagram.

1777
02:29:45,828 --> 02:29:48,988
Calm down, people. I'm getting goosebumps.

1778
02:29:48,988 --> 02:29:50,523
Oh, right.

1779
02:29:50,523 --> 02:29:53,702
What's going to happen to that game you've been working on?

1780
02:29:53,702 --> 02:29:56,229
My company has been following its progress.

1781
02:29:56,229 --> 02:29:58,240
So I was going to give them a call.

1782
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:59,865
I guess someone else will have to do it.

1783
02:29:59,865 --> 02:30:02,745
What is there to think about? Dex is more important.

1784
02:30:02,745 --> 02:30:05,682
Is that so? The reason why they were interested

1785
02:30:05,682 --> 02:30:08,320
in the first place was because of his design. So who knows what will happen next?

1786
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:10,300
I kind of feel sorry for the other guy.

1787
02:30:10,309 --> 02:30:13,946
Can we visit the headquarters if we go to France?

1788
02:30:13,946 --> 02:30:16,392
- Drink up. We can get accepted, too.
- Really?

1789
02:30:16,392 --> 02:30:18,060
- We can?
- Of course!

1790
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:21,254
- Yeah, I wish.
- When are we getting a job?

1791
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:24,424
Not anytime soon.

1792
02:30:24,424 --> 02:30:27,927
- I envy him.
- How much does Dex pay?

1793
02:30:28,595 --> 02:30:30,295
It's robably ten times what I earn.

1794
02:30:30,295 --> 02:30:32,107
- Ten times?
- Yeah.

1795
02:30:32,107 --> 02:30:34,967
- That much?
- Yeah! It's Dex!

1796
02:30:36,736 --> 02:30:39,448
Man, those punks sure do talk a lot.

1797
02:30:39,448 --> 02:30:42,242
They're going to talk behind your back anyway.

1798
02:30:47,347 --> 02:30:51,083
Before, when I was with Sangchoo,

1799
02:30:51,083 --> 02:30:53,686
he asked about everyone you dated before.

1800
02:30:53,686 --> 02:30:54,864
You didn't!

1801
02:30:54,864 --> 02:30:58,658
So I counted all of them with my fingers.

1802
02:30:59,592 --> 02:31:03,029
Thankfully, there weren't more than ten.

1803
02:31:06,533 --> 02:31:09,045
I wonder what I did in my past life to deserve this.

1804
02:31:09,045 --> 02:31:11,337
I should've stopped there.

1805
02:31:11,337 --> 02:31:14,750
But damn… I guess I riled him up.

1806
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:20,012
I said it seemed like you were going to die soon because you'd changed.

1807
02:31:23,116 --> 02:31:25,317
Did I do something wrong?

1808
02:31:26,986 --> 02:31:29,088
I don't know anymore.

1809
02:31:29,088 --> 02:31:34,327
He treats people like they're products, so I don't know what he's so worried about.

1810
02:31:35,095 --> 02:31:37,363
But you know what's funny?

1811
02:31:37,363 --> 02:31:41,100
You know, because of the guy who asked you about my love life,

1812
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:43,637
I can't think about anything else.

1813
02:31:44,938 --> 02:31:49,008
I want to find him right now and ask him.

1814
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:52,711
You, didn't you have something to tell me?

1815
02:31:52,711 --> 02:31:54,581
It's nothing.

1816
02:31:59,486 --> 02:32:02,722
I want to ask what it was that he wanted to tell me.

1817
02:32:05,425 --> 02:32:09,095
I want to ask him how he feels

1818
02:32:09,095 --> 02:32:11,698
about me leaving.

1819
02:32:16,069 --> 02:32:20,439
I guess Jaeyeong is like anyone else. You get boring when you fall in love.

1820
02:32:20,439 --> 02:32:23,109
I shouldn't have told you this.

1821
02:32:23,109 --> 02:32:25,278
Hey, isn't that normal?

1822
02:32:25,278 --> 02:32:27,747
People get tiresome and stale.

1823
02:32:27,747 --> 02:32:32,785
For the past few years, you've always been so cool.

1824
02:32:33,419 --> 02:32:39,759
You see… You can't be cool once you sincerely like someone.

1825
02:32:44,931 --> 02:32:46,732
Face it, you're not cool anymore.

1826
02:32:46,732 --> 02:32:48,310
What do you want me to do?

1827
02:32:48,310 --> 02:32:53,182
Just... Just be your usual self. Don't try to think too much about it.

1828
02:32:53,182 --> 02:32:56,509
Just be like the Jaeyeong I know.

1829
02:32:57,177 --> 02:33:01,113
Come on, stop making me cringe. I'm leaving.

1830
02:33:01,113 --> 02:33:03,850
Pay for me as well.

1831
02:33:15,461 --> 02:33:18,198
Be like the Jaeyeong you know…

1832
02:33:29,075 --> 02:33:31,477
It was going to get erased anyways.

1833
02:33:37,183 --> 02:33:39,180
Are you studying?

1834
02:33:41,153 --> 02:33:43,150
Come outside for a bit.

1835
02:33:55,435 --> 02:33:57,470
Happy birthday.

1836
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,943
I'm the first one to congratulate you, right?

1837
02:34:03,943 --> 02:34:06,079
I mean, it's only been ten minutes.

1838
02:34:06,913 --> 02:34:08,624
How did you know?

1839
02:34:08,624 --> 02:34:11,227
You sent your resume when you submitted the plans.

1840
02:34:11,227 --> 02:34:12,795
1001.

1841
02:34:12,795 --> 02:34:17,323
It's like a binary number. Even your birthday's like you.

1842
02:34:18,324 --> 02:34:21,460
You're so weird.

1843
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:24,597
I'll say something crazy while you're at it.

1844
02:34:25,331 --> 02:34:27,767
I'm not going to Dex.

1845
02:34:28,768 --> 02:34:30,646
I'm going to help you with the game.

1846
02:34:30,646 --> 02:34:33,806
- Senior…
- You said nobody else can do it.

1847
02:34:35,775 --> 02:34:38,310
You said you needed me.

1848
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:41,280
- No, back then—
- I feel the same way.

1849
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,483
I need you, too.

1850
02:34:44,117 --> 02:34:46,352
My heart is telling me that.

1851
02:34:55,762 --> 02:35:01,464
What you proposed before, I'm ready to answer.

1852
02:35:05,138 --> 02:35:07,606
I reject your proposal.

1853
02:35:07,606 --> 02:35:10,109
Please go to Dex.

1854
02:35:14,047 --> 02:35:17,616
- Chu Sangwoo.
- I just don't understand.

1855
02:35:17,617 --> 02:35:23,389
Do you really think I would be happy if you decided not to go because of me?

1856
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:30,963
I'm sorry but… I'm not the stupid protagonist of a romance novel.

1857
02:35:35,034 --> 02:35:38,781
I see that your useless reasoning is working hard today.

1858
02:35:38,781 --> 02:35:43,175
Call me when the backup file is complete.

1859
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:49,214
Sangwoo.

1860
02:35:50,183 --> 02:35:53,452
What is your heart telling you right now?

1861
02:35:58,991 --> 02:36:01,561
I don't care.

1862
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:07,400
I just hope you succeed.

1863
02:36:09,102 --> 02:36:11,036
I mean it.

1864
02:36:14,207 --> 02:36:16,609
Thank you for the cake.

1865
02:36:33,259 --> 02:36:35,862
Is he telling me to leave after that?

1866
02:36:37,497 --> 02:36:39,431
Bastard.

1867
02:36:58,651 --> 02:37:00,753
Is this a curse?

1874
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:07,013
Long time no see, Sangwoo.

1875
02:39:11,751 --> 02:39:14,186
Are you preparing for your exams?

1876
02:39:15,121 --> 02:39:16,555
Yes.

1877
02:39:18,558 --> 02:39:21,393
Did you find a replacement designer?

1878
02:39:23,062 --> 02:39:26,165
I'll look for one after the exams.

1879
02:39:26,165 --> 02:39:28,467
Please don't worry about it.

1880
02:39:29,068 --> 02:39:33,305
I'm not worried. I'm sure you'll find someone.

1881
02:39:34,707 --> 02:39:36,675
Oh, I almost forgot.

1882
02:39:40,112 --> 02:39:41,880
The backup files.

1883
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:44,216
It's also on the hard drive.

1884
02:39:50,723 --> 02:39:53,192
I'm relieved that I could give it to you in person.

1885
02:39:53,826 --> 02:39:57,095
Yes. Thank you.

1886
02:40:18,718 --> 02:40:21,587
Why would you drink like that?

1887
02:40:21,587 --> 02:40:24,122
Doesn't your throat hurt?

1888
02:40:24,122 --> 02:40:28,026
It's fine. I felt a bit stuffy there.

1889
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:34,600
- So—
- Can I speak first?

1890
02:40:35,868 --> 02:40:40,339
I don't want you to get the wrong idea and give you irrelevant advice again.

1891
02:40:40,973 --> 02:40:43,375
Oh, okay.

1892
02:40:43,375 --> 02:40:46,445
Thank you.

1893
02:40:55,454 --> 02:40:57,356
I...

1894
02:40:58,190 --> 02:41:00,559
I like you a lot.

1895
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:03,572
I know it's so sudden, but if not now,

1896
02:41:03,572 --> 02:41:08,167
I don't think I'll ever be able to tell you this.

1897
02:41:09,035 --> 02:41:14,006
I just wanted to confess before you rejected me.

1898
02:41:22,481 --> 02:41:24,049
Sorry.

1899
02:41:25,017 --> 02:41:28,454
How should I respond?

1900
02:41:29,488 --> 02:41:34,059
You don't need to. You know I can see it in your face.

1901
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:39,098
To be honest, I knew from the start. I just wanted to tell you, that's all.

1902
02:41:39,799 --> 02:41:45,771
Before, I was worried my world would be shattered if you rejected me.

1903
02:41:45,771 --> 02:41:48,775
But I actually feel relieved.

1904
02:41:49,475 --> 02:41:54,713
Also, I think I can feel more comfortable around you now.

1905
02:41:54,713 --> 02:41:58,917
How about you? Do you still feel uncomfortable around me?

1906
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:02,254
No.

1907
02:42:03,322 --> 02:42:06,501
Of course, you never know until you try it.

1908
02:42:06,501 --> 02:42:09,495
Good job, Jihye.

1909
02:42:12,565 --> 02:42:15,501
But, Sangwoo, I was a bit surprised.

1910
02:42:15,501 --> 02:42:16,902
About what?

1911
02:42:17,603 --> 02:42:20,849
"Sorry, but I don't want to waste my time."

1912
02:42:20,849 --> 02:42:23,485
I thought you would say that.

1913
02:42:23,485 --> 02:42:26,544
But you're here listening and drinking coffee with me.

1914
02:42:26,544 --> 02:42:29,081
I think you've changed.

1915
02:42:29,081 --> 02:42:30,816
I have?

1916
02:42:30,816 --> 02:42:34,519
Yes. I think you've improved.

1917
02:42:46,932 --> 02:42:52,738
They say love changes a man. I guess those romance novels weren't fake after all.

1918
02:42:54,273 --> 02:42:57,586
I'm too jealous to root for you on the sidelines,

1919
02:42:57,586 --> 02:43:00,550
