(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.699
You should get inside.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.169
- Come closer. - What?

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:11.839
That was a lie.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.150
Then you should change it as soon as...

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.379
Actually, I had milk at home.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.450
That was pretty smooth. Wasn't it?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
Let's go upstairs.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.399
Let's go up.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.329
Wait. Do you want to watch a late-night movie instead? Then...

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.970
Gosh, no. Of course, we should go upstairs.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.509
(Episode 9)

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.429
Answer it.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.030
Gosh, no.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.739
I told you. Some students call us before the exam.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.840
Gosh, I don't have to answer this. It's Seoung Gyu.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.349
Excuse me for a second.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.979
Hey, what is it?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.149
Hey. You'll be home soon. Right?

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.689
I'm going to order fried chicken. Come and pay for it.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.989
Okay. Sure. Go ahead. Order it.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.070
What is it?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.070
Is something wrong with Seoung Gyu?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.599
No. Well,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.438
Seoung Gyu helped me move into my new place today.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.610
- He's still at my house. - Okay.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.980
Let me go and feed him. I need 30 minutes. No.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.679
I mean, I'll come back as fast as I can.

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:00.380
- As fast as you can? - Yes.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.290
I'll come back in a jiffy.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.019
So could you wait for me?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.290
- Gosh. Thank you. - We must've made you wait long.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.160
- Gosh. Come on. - Oh, no.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.670
What am I going to do?

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:19.839
I'm sorry.

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.480
- Thank you. I appreciate it. - Bye.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.839
Honey!

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.480
This too.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.179
It's fine.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.189
- Anyway, - Yes.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.330
wait for me.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.200
Don't fall asleep.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.600
- Promise me. - Okay.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.700
- I'll be back soon. - Okay.

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:02.649
Gosh.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.379
Right.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.270
Hey. You're home early.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.530
Yes.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.970
What do you think? I did a great job cleaning the house, didn't I?

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.610
Yes. Hey, thank you. It's so spotless I got goosebumps.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.980
Here.

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.389
Let's see.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.340
- What are you doing? - What?

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.569
Well, you worked hard to clean the house today.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:48.069
You should drink some nice liquor.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.540
Why did you just sit down like that?

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:52.239
What do you mean?

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.109
You've been outside.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.610
Wash your hands and change your clothes first.

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:00.350
I was about to get changed.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.089
This is good.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.990
Hey. Should we invite Ho Jae?

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:48.630
Why?

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:51.400
He said he had a company dinner today.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.359
Let's invite him for the second round.

00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:55.269
Gosh, what are you talking about?

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.229
He has work tomorrow morning. Why would we invite him here?

00:09:58.839 --> 00:09:59.870
Let's just drink by ourselves.

00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:01.540
All right. Here.

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:46.079
This is so good.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.689
You know what?

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.530
Invite Seo Hye Jin over.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.729
You said she lived nearby.

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:01.669
Gosh, what's up with you, jerk?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.829
Why do you want to invite people whenever you drink? Seriously.

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:08.270
You know, when I was mopping the floor all day,

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.809
I solved a very important puzzle.

00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:13.010
How should I put it?

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:16.079
As a scholar of history, I would say it was a major discovery.

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.249
- Yes. What is it? - You know?

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.620
- I wanted to tell you about that. - I see. Gosh.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.589
That sounds incredibly boring. Seriously.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.760
It's about you.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.420
What?

00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:32.929
Over the years, I've met your ex-girlfriends several times.

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:35.869
So what?

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.928
You want me to invite my current girlfriend,

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:38.469
so you can tell her about my dating history?

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.670
- What are you, a lunatic? - Come on. Just hear me out.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.410
Strangely, I couldn't figure out your type.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.780
From my observation,

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.818
your ex-girlfriends didn't have anything in common. You know?

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:53.079
That's how I felt.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.890
If I must find something in common with all of your past relationships,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.420
you dated them only briefly.

00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:00.859
So what?

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:03.689
But they did have it.

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:05.959
All of them had this critical feature in common.

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:08.829
What was it?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.270
- Are you curious? - Come on.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.870
Yes. Tell me.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.209
Drumroll, please.

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:23.380
The dimples.

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:28.620
All of your ex-girlfriends had dimples.

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:34.319
Right? That's Seo Hye Jin's trademark feature.

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:38.959
Gosh. You haven't changed, have you?

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.300
Don't wait for me. Go to sleep.

00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:45.640
What?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.299
Hey, where are you going?

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.640
Come on. You know where.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:50.140
Invite Ho Jae or do whatever you want.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.439
By the way,

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:54.978
if you don't use a proper title to call her next time,

00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:57.010
I swear. I'm going to kill you.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.050
Seriously.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.300
I'm on my way now.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.280
I'll cut you some slack tonight.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.800
Come on in.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.540
- Gosh. - Goodness.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.079
You're sweating. Aren't you cold?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.550
I think I just ran 100m...

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:12.250
in eight seconds.

00:15:12.819 --> 00:15:14.150
I should be a gold medalist.

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:19.689
Seriously.

00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:25.599
Oh, no.

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:39.280
I'm coming in.

00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:27.719
Wait.

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:31.599
The light... Let's turn that off.

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:43.109
Ms. Seo.

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.410
I want to see your face.

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:48.949
Wait.

00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:52.779
- I... - I won't turn on the light.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.819
Okay.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520
All right.

00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:57.719
Can I...

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:06.030
- Ms. Seo. I... - Could you move?

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.530
Oh, no.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.099
Goodness. Are you hurt?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.640
Are you okay?

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.009
What did you land on first?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.010
Oh, no. You didn't fall on your head first, right?

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.149
Well, could you explain to me what's going on first?

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:25.419
Oh, no.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.750
- Did you have a change of heart? - No, that's not it.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.918
Are you that dense?

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.930
- What? - Gosh. I...

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:39.358
I don't know how much more I need to teach you.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.700
- Wait. Ms. Seo. What... - Hey, that!

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:44.770
- Don't do that. - Ms. Seo.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.300
Don't call me like I'm still your teacher.

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:50.169
Gosh. When I hear you say that,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.109
I feel like I'm doing something wrong to you.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.589
Let me see.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.550
What did you land on first?

00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:05.419
Gosh, seriously.

00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:08.529
We got really lucky.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.089
If I fell forward like this,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.159
you would have lived alone for the rest of your life.

00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:15.899
That's your fault, though.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.800
Okay.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.869
Then teach me properly.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.020
I thought you were...

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.419
I have to confess something.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.040
I can't see your face now.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.639
Go ahead. Confess.

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:00.409
I...

00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:05.379
I...

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.020
I can't teach this.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.790
What?

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:18.629
You knew that, didn't you?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.970
Gosh, no. I thought you were a total pro.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.409
What else?

00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:32.909
Is there anything else I should know?

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.510
I don't think so.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.020
Then, I'll tell you something this time.

00:19:43.589 --> 00:19:44.690
Seo Hye Jin,

00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:47.690
I love you.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.430
For much longer than I thought,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.740
I've loved you.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.440
Should I say it one more time?

00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:10.149
Seo Hye Jin...

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:17.490
You don't have to say it.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.859
I can feel it...

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.099
more than enough.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:55.520
You can sleep more.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.250
You have to go, don't you?

00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:58.659
Yes.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.430
Gosh, Seoung Gyu. I should've just stopped being friends with him.

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:23.209
- I'll go to work separately. - Okay.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.020
I think I should at least feed that punk Seoung Gyu breakfast.

00:22:28.649 --> 00:22:31.319
Go home and get some more sleep. You have time in the morning.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.690
Since I have more time...

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.399
Oh, my! Where are you going?

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.389
Excuse me.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.319
Are you perhaps Mr. Pyo Sang Seob?

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.930
Yes, I am.

00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:49.129
Here.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.069
Why have you come to see me?

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.609
It seemed you didn't answer calls from numbers you don't know.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.010
I mean, what does an academy want to do with me?

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.849
Could I perhaps escort you to my car?

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.879
I will explain to you on the way.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.919
Well, it won't be something that makes you uncomfortable.

00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:20.200
I'll see you at the academy.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.669
Don't be late.

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:25.270
In case you miss me until then?

00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:27.338
- Kids get their grades today. - Gosh.

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:28.339
Aren't you nervous?

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.579
Not really. I taught them perfectly.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.109
I even held myself back from wanting to hug someone.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.020
- Hello. - Hello.

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:43.849
The doors are closing.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.250
Good morning, friends.

00:25:49.349 --> 00:25:51.220
Finally, the day of the Korean exam is upon us.

00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:54.189
Don't get nervous and think of today as the day...

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.889
where you'll be repaid for your effort until now.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.159
Let's keep up your energy just a little longer.

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.200
For questions you know, don't make mistakes.

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:02.300
For confusing questions, get through it with the energy of the universe.

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.800
Let's go! Our whole class will get perfect scores!

00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:06.339
You can do it!

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.899
What's with these emoticons?

00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:09.740
Is this really Ms. Seo?

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.809
Hey, do you think Ms. Seo has been hacked?

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.079
She sounds like a totally different person.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280
No way.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.889
Ms. Seo seems to be in a good mood lately, doesn't she?

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.359
I'm sure she is happy.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.659
They'll get some free time too once our exams are over.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.389
What do you think today's questions will be like?

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:32.558
I'm so scared.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.059
I'm totally confident.

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:36.700
Ms. Seo even summarized Sang Seob's breathing sounds for us.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:41.369
There are too many eyes watching in Daechi-dong.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.139
Also, it's during exam season.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.409
First, our director, Ms. Choi told me to tell you...

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.450
that she wanted to apologize for meeting you like this...

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:50.980
under these conditions.

00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:59.819
If you look next to you, you'll see an envelope.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.790
It's a contract with Choisun Academy.

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:07.730
The director's business card is also inside.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.569
Please take a look and give us a call.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.309
Please stop the car at any subway station you see next.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.710
Yes, Ms. Choi.

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.220
Yes, I met with him.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.720
He left the contract as is and got out of the car in the middle,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.089
just as you predicted.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.629
Yes, then I will head to your house right away.

00:28:13.129 --> 00:28:15.829
(Exit 1, Junggye 3-dong, Exit 6, Nowon Community Hall)

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.290
- You are ready for it, right? - Oh, gosh.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.919
Let's call it even after you tell me the passcode to your house.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.220
"Call it even?" You punk.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.460
Gosh, don't worry.

00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:18.230
It's not like I'll come every day.

00:29:19.159 --> 00:29:20.559
I'll only come on days when school gets out late.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.200
Get lost.

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:25.169
Okay.

00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:43.319
Hi, Mom. Have you gone to work?

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:47.290
Oh, yes. Jun Ho's move went well.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.730
But yesterday, this punk...

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:51.960
Zero, three, two, seven.

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:55.300
- Zero, three, two, seven. - Gosh, he must've been tired.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.329
He passed out as soon as he got home.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.470
I'm sure he is tired.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.270
The makeup classes for finals just ended yesterday.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.878
Yes, okay.

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:08.809
Hey, Seoung Gyu. You should eat something expensive.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.609
If he asked my precious son to do hard labor,

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:13.180
he should at least buy you a good meal.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.319
Okay. Bye.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.889
Why did you come so early?

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.889
I couldn't sleep well because I was nervous on the kids' exam day.

00:30:24.629 --> 00:30:27.460
Even the great Ms. Nam Cheong Mi gets nervous too.

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:29.700
Only during the kids' exam season.

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:31.629
Don't worry.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.540
From the moms to the kids, you have great reviews.

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:39.280
Reviews aren't done with words but with grades.

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:41.480
Right.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.659
Hey, Min Ji. I'm on my way to work now.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.199
Send out a notice to tell the kids to send us their estimated scores...

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.899
as soon as they're finished.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.739
And you know how some kids go silent when they tank their exams.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.940
Reach out to those kids separately.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.809
Yes. I'll stop by the bookstore before I go to work.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.280
Bye.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.950
(Things to note during exams)

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.430
Anyone has questions about the exam questions?

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:36.899
Sir.

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:39.569
Could I please have another OMR card?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Here.

(Choi Min Ji)

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:57.980
Hey, Min Ji. The kids are finished, right?

00:32:58.379 --> 00:32:59.419
Yes, Ms. Seo.

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:02.449
Yes, both Chanyoung and Heewon High Schools are finished.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.389
The kids have started sending in their estimated scores.

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:07.418
From Heewon High, Si Woo, Hye Seung,

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:08.519
Han Gyeol, and Yun Chan...

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.159
got perfect scores on the multiple choice section.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.700
I think it'd take me some time to sort through Chanyoung High's.

00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:15.659
There are so many who got perfect scores on the multiple choice.

00:33:17.129 --> 00:33:18.800
I'll take a look at Chanyoung High's scores when I get to work.

00:33:19.139 --> 00:33:22.169
Gosh, having too many perfect scores on multiple choice is hard too.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.309
No, I feel great.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.210
But in that case, the grading for the short answers will get picky.

00:33:27.579 --> 00:33:28.710
Anyway, let's talk once I get there.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.980
Yes, please print out the exam papers that we got.

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:32.980
Okay, Ms. Seo. I'll see you later.

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.149
Gosh!

00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:40.859
Ms. Choi.

00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:42.959
Our predictions on three passages were correct.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.088
Oh, really?

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:45.459
And from the classics too!

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.359
Oh, my! Congratulations!

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.530
This is awesome.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.530
Hello.

00:33:49.599 --> 00:33:50.970
- Hello. - Hello.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.139
Gosh, I'm finally starting to feel less nervous.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.500
That's great.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:55.909
Thank you!

00:33:56.339 --> 00:33:57.409
What's great?

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.510

(Chanyoung High School, 2023 2nd Semester Final Exams)

Here are Chanyoung High School's exam questions.

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:15.930
Should I try to meet Mr. Pyo Sang Seob again?

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.789
He didn't even think to open up the contract,

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.899
so it was hard to talk to him.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.030
Leave it.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.300
Pardon?

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.120
First floor.

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:20.359
Going up.

00:35:26.899 --> 00:35:28.430
You're here early, Ms. Seo.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.129
You're early too, Mr. Lee.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.569
It seems like the kids who took exams today will have good results.

00:35:34.669 --> 00:35:35.910
I got the message too.

00:35:36.769 --> 00:35:38.169
If you're not too busy,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.108
could I have a 1-on-1 meeting with you for a bit?

00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:42.140
- Well, I'm a very busy person. - I see.

00:35:44.979 --> 00:35:46.220
It'll only take five minutes.

00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:04.499
Did you send Seoung Gyu off well?

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.999
I got a message from Si Woo that he did well on the exam.

00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:09.169
I heard it from Min Ji.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.310
This is seriously awesome.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.379
Did you feel like this when you were watching me?

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.220
What's this? I thought you didn't get nervous.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.889
I don't let on when I feel nervous or anxious.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:25.919
It doesn't look cool.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.858
This won't do. I'll head out first.

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:31.859
Come outside a little later.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.459
Wait.

00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:37.300

- Are you just coming into work? - Yes.

Then, why are you coming up from here?

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.829
Oh, I left something after teaching class yesterday.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:10.870
How about you?

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.100
Oh, I left my pouch in the classroom yesterday too.

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:16.539
I must've been exhausted from doing makeup classes right before exams.

00:37:20.209 --> 00:37:21.939
Wait. But...

00:37:22.539 --> 00:37:25.248
Wasn't your class yesterday in the small lecture hall here,

00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:26.479
not downstairs?

00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:29.950
I was mistaken. I'm going to go there now.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.589
I see.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.990
I guess even you make such mistakes at times.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.620
I must be exhausted too.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.490
- Okay, then. - Bye.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.200
Leave the room later. And take the elevator on your way up.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:10.890
Mr. Lee?

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.160
Oh, hi, Ms. Kim.

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.629
Why did you come here before coming to the office?

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.999
I came in early and decided to practice...

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.640
on the blackboard.

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:24.240
- Oh... - Why are you down here?

00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:26.209
I left something behind.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.539
I see.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.910
You're so hard-working,

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.550
practicing right after the exam lecture.

00:38:32.149 --> 00:38:33.819
There's always a lot to do.

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.050
You'll be a great instructor.

00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:39.288
Thank you. Bye, then.

00:38:39.289 --> 00:38:41.419
Do you know something?

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.129
What?

00:38:43.789 --> 00:38:45.589
I'm the best at writing on the board.

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:50.499
People sometimes say I'm even better than Ms. Seo.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.470
Yes. I heard through the grapevine.

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.339
Do you need a special lecture?

00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.010
Will I have to break into...

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:02.910
my savings to pay you for it?

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.878
I'll give you a special deal.

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:11.189
I'll teach you for the price of one dinner.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.489
Well, the thing is...

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.829
Shall I help you with it right now?

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.229
Oh, no. I think I should practice a bit first.

00:39:22.729 --> 00:39:24.769
Okay. Then...

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.969
Text me after you practice.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.568
- I'll come and help you out. - No, it's fine.

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:32.470
You don't have to refuse.

00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:34.140
I don't eat much.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.899
These were fine, but it's a shame Ye Eun got this wrong.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.760
- Right? - Yes. She must've been sloppy.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.029
I taught this.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.030
Excuse me.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.068
Hey. I'll go through the rest in my own time.

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:04.410
- You can get back to work. - Okay.

00:40:13.019 --> 00:40:14.180
I'm locked up in here.

00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:17.350
Ms. Kim's going to check my blackboard skills.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.379
Ms. Seo.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.080
Ms. Seo.

00:40:50.149 --> 00:40:51.289
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.209
Shall I rescue you?

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.120
Please.

00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:32.029
Can someone call Mr. Lee?

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.160
Why isn't he in yet? I need to talk to him.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.569
- I'll call him. - He's here.

00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:39.600
He's downstairs practicing his board-writing.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.339
I'll call him.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.240
Lee Si Woo.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.240
Why are you here?

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.180
Tell Mr. Lee to run upstairs.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.489
You're saying you got them all right...

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.390
but not because you knew how or why?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.160
Yes.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.889
If not for the list of questions you gave me the day before,

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.089
I'd have gotten it wrong.

00:42:10.399 --> 00:42:11.729
First, you deserve praise.

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:15.269
If what you said was true,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.639
I'd have lost control at number five.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.309
But you got through the rest of the exam well.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.339
That's impressive.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.809
That's nothing.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.818
And second, even after getting it right,

00:42:27.819 --> 00:42:29.688
you thought about what it was that you didn't get.

00:42:29.689 --> 00:42:30.950
That's even more impressive.

00:42:31.919 --> 00:42:34.660
I'd have gotten it wrong if I didn't recognize the passage.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.160
Even now, I'm not sure what the options mean.

00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:42.359
I just memorized what you said...

00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:44.030
the traditional singer's soul meant...

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.899
and guessed based on that.

00:42:46.769 --> 00:42:48.240
What Mr. Lee means...

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.740
is that you're thinking on a high level.

00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:52.339
Students in their final year...

00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:55.609
and only just the best few wonder about that.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.978
Because it feels like literature isn't about finding...

00:42:58.979 --> 00:43:00.249
the answer among five options.

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:06.660
What is it?

00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:08.620
That's exactly...

00:43:09.789 --> 00:43:11.030
how I feel.

00:43:14.399 --> 00:43:16.628
I want to take the exam with trust and belief...

00:43:16.629 --> 00:43:18.370
that I'm perfectly prepared.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.899
I'm like that with the other subjects.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.039
But Korean...

00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:27.080
Especially literature...

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.580
I'm always left with that weird feeling.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.419
That's why I bullheadedly try to solve more problems.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.589
I spend more time studying,

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.589
but I don't see an improvement.

00:43:40.019 --> 00:43:42.990
So the reason you came over as soon as the exam ended is?

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:45.430
I just...

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.100
You wanted to talk, right?

00:43:52.499 --> 00:43:55.539
Your friends would kill you if you said this at school.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.240
Especially boys.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.109
They'd say things like, "The jerk's showing off."

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.519
- Yes. - I'm glad you came over.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.649
You gave me a great assignment.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.890
Can you help me?

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.689
There's something you don't know.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.959
I do almost everything I set my mind to.

00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:26.300
I'm tasked with making sure...

00:44:26.939 --> 00:44:29.269
your Korean score stays at the top.

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.069
But I just changed my goal.

00:44:36.749 --> 00:44:38.179
Will you send me to med school?

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.680
It's not something that silly.

00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:44.620
I want to help you get full marks at the KSAT.

00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:46.189
The best student in the country.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.689
Okay?

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:52.330
You'd better mention me when you're interviewed afterward.

00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:54.399
Okay.

00:44:58.129 --> 00:45:00.669
Si Woo's so serious about his studies.

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:08.180
I suddenly got scared.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.310
Why did you say you'd help him get full marks in the KSAT?

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.280
I'm not scared of that.

00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:18.749
I was wondering if I would lose the title of your favorite student.

00:45:21.859 --> 00:45:22.919
Does it not matter now?

00:45:23.629 --> 00:45:24.990
Because I'm not your favorite student anymore,

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.060
but your boyfriend.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.870
Are you crazy?

00:45:34.169 --> 00:45:35.899
Academy life is so thrilling.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.959
(Chanyoung High School)

00:45:57.859 --> 00:45:59.030
This answer here.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.629
Should I deduct a point?

00:46:04.399 --> 00:46:07.539
Yes. It's missing the word "positive."

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.410
It's still a good answer.

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:15.609
We might have to deduct points for not putting a full stop.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:17.780
Be strict.

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:20.019
You don't have to go that far.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.249
Should we have added more question so they'd be short on time?

00:46:26.819 --> 00:46:28.620
We lost to the students this time.

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.260
They studied,

00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:32.760
understood the textbook, and did well.

00:46:33.129 --> 00:46:35.359
If the average score goes up, the teachers lose,

00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:36.870
and if it goes down, we win?

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.970
Why even say such a thing?

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.039
Because we must categorize their grades.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.410
We must line them up from first to last.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.740
That's why we're staring...

00:46:49.979 --> 00:46:52.079
at the short-answer questions trying to find reasons...

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.080
to dock points until our eyes bleed.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.120
We just check if they paid attention in class.

00:46:59.419 --> 00:47:01.119
I wish I got hit by a car during...

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.819
the grade confirmation period.

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.390
Why would you...

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.800
Don't say something like that.

00:47:09.229 --> 00:47:11.830
I know what the kids and their parents will say.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.600
I'd much prefer an accident.

00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:15.140
That doesn't scare me.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:17.409
Then will you go on...

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.140
It must be so nice not to be scared by that.

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:22.410
Ms. Lee.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.649
He's a full-time teacher.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.919
He'll never have the same stance as temporary teachers like us.

00:47:29.319 --> 00:47:30.589
That was foolish of me.

00:47:31.789 --> 00:47:33.519
I forgot the gap in our status.

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:35.560
Stop it, Ms. Lee.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.769
Even full-time teachers like me...

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.439
dislike getting complaints from students and parents.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.740
It's about our belief, not our status.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.709
What belief?

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.950
Did you ever try to understand my intentions?

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.950
Helping the students read and gain a broad understanding of...

00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:07.490
I quit.

00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:11.689
"Gain a broad understanding of the texts?"

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.160
Who? The students?

00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:18.830
Do you really not get it or are you pretending not to?

00:48:22.439 --> 00:48:24.939
You all did well preparing for the final exams.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:27.180
Ms. Nam and Mr. Lee.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.709
Congratulations on getting through the first exam with us.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.780
You taught and led the students well.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.450
Thank you. You were a great help.

00:48:36.479 --> 00:48:39.148
Without your help, I wouldn't have been able to...

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:41.490
figure out Pyo Sang Seob's style as well as I did.

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.390
I must be lucky.

00:48:44.859 --> 00:48:46.628
Two great instructors joined...

00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:48.100
and settled in so quickly.

00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:52.729
Can we have a team dinner?

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.140
Sounds good.

00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:58.939
Go to a classroom, grab any kid,

00:48:59.439 --> 00:49:01.410
and ask to see the material from their academy.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.280
Handouts and notes from their class and the others.

00:49:05.249 --> 00:49:07.450
They collected them all and had them memorize it for a month.

00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:12.350
They even pointed out which word we read in a higher tone.

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.160
That's the academy instructor's job.

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:18.490
Are we doing this to make instructors feel better?

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:19.760
The textbook...

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.600
is the most basic and organized frame of thought.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.569
- We must have a belief that... - If you care so much about belief,

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.739
run for office as superintendent of education.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.970
- Ms. Lee. - I said I quit.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.080
At this rate, it's obvious...

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.709
my evaluation will be a disaster.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.149
I'll be badmouthed online too.

00:49:44.289 --> 00:49:45.589
I want out before that happens.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.019
Then Ms. Lee,

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.129
what do you think I should do?

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.060
- Shall I really tell you? - Yes.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.539
We don't understand each other well.

00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:05.740
Can you just...

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.839
not do anything?

No, on the director's.

00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:51.519
He's pleased our team did well.

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:53.149
- Goodness. - Nice.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.220
Mr. Lee must be sick of this.

So what? You'll make him first in his year?

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.018
Yes. He promised to mention me in his interview...

when he gets full marks.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.760
My gosh. You're hilarious, Mr. Lee.

- Am I? - How are you so funny?

00:53:19.499 --> 00:53:20.700
That was crazy funny.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.809

Right.

I'll help if I can.

What's up, Ms. Nam?

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.280
Are you showing off that you majored in Korean?

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.979
Yes. I showed off.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.418
Let's talk about something else.

00:54:11.419 --> 00:54:13.149
This is boring.

How about a toast?

Cheers, Mr. Lee.

What are your plans for the year-end?

00:54:24.399 --> 00:54:25.430
Right.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.568
I don't have any special plans.

00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:32.410
Why not? Visit Jeju Island. It's amazing.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.608

You can stay the night.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.679
Is that what's special?

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.779
- Yes. - It's fine.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.180
- It's nicer in the winter. - I can stay at the academy.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.819
No. I want to talk with you some more.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.089
- Really? - Really.

00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:49.319
That's incredible.

00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:51.889
Can I stay for one more...

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.958
- Let's just go. - I want to sing.

- Bye. - I'll get her home.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.228
- Thanks. - Sure.

00:54:57.229 --> 00:54:58.629
- Take care. - Let's go.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.568
- Wait, I didn't... - We can go now.

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:02.569
Goodness.

00:55:03.169 --> 00:55:05.140
Get home safely, Mr. Lee.

00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:06.939
Our taxi's on its way.

00:55:07.939 --> 00:55:10.749
What? Don't you live near here?

00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:13.550
Oh, no. I moved.

00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:18.919

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:23.959

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:25.660
Sorry.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.669
- Thanks. - Thank you.

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:40.879
Drive safely.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.680
We'll get some stuff here. You can go home.

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.649
I'll carry the stuff for you.

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:48.979
It would be even better if you'd let me join in.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.589
Can you not be so nosy?

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.760
- Hey. - What's going on?

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.129
It's just me.

00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:59.890
Hello, Ms. Seo.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:02.030
- Long time no see, Seoung Gyu. - Yes.

00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:03.498
I heard, Ms. Seo.

00:56:03.499 --> 00:56:05.728
- I see. - Shouldn't you go home?

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.369
- Yes. - Hey.

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.399
See you.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:10.970
Bye.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.089
This is Ms. Nam Cheong Mi. She's on our team.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.789
This is my friend Choi Seoung Gyu. He's a post-grad student.

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:32.890
His mother is our counselor Ms. Kim.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.560
My gosh.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.300
I feel so much better now.

00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:43.039
The suspense was killing me.

00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:45.470
We met, didn't we?

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.240
Yes. Outside your apartment block.

00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:50.410
That's right.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.748
After I realized...

00:56:52.749 --> 00:56:55.479
Mr. Pyo taught at a school here,

00:56:55.519 --> 00:56:57.050
I went to see the counselor.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.648
To ask if I could teach a Chanyoung High class.

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.689
I see.

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.560
Are you allowed to discuss that so openly?

00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:06.490
Isn't that a trade secret?

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:08.800
It's in the past.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.800
And I hate secrets.

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.169
Hello.

00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:16.269
- Thanks. - Enjoy the food.

00:57:21.709 --> 00:57:23.140
There are kids like that.

00:57:23.479 --> 00:57:25.680
Reading's fine because there's a logic to it,

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.620
but things like literature that need imagination is daunting.

00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:31.089
It's not the kids' fault.

00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:34.419
Neither school nor academies teach how to empathize with the author.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:38.789
It takes a lot of courage to actually do that.

00:57:40.289 --> 00:57:43.430
Can you even imagine or empathize during an exam?

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.169
Isn't that too idealistic?

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:55.910
Was it back in 2013?

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.180
During a 12th-grade exam,

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.180
all the students burst into tears.

00:58:01.879 --> 00:58:03.580
No Hee Kyung's work, right?

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.990
Yes.

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:08.459
A woman cared for her mother-in-law who had serious dementia,

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:11.358
raised her kids well, and supported her husband.

00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:12.830
She was a hard-working mom.

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.100
She's diagnosed with cancer.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.799
She says goodbye to each member of her family...

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.030
before her life comes to an end.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.569
The last page of her script came up in the exam.

00:58:23.769 --> 00:58:26.640
All the kids bawled at that part.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:28.010
- Yes. - Yes.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.249
It is possible to imagine and empathize during an exam.

00:58:32.379 --> 00:58:34.748
There's just no guarantee it translates to good grades.

00:58:34.749 --> 00:58:36.950
That's no good, then.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.120
Hey. Don't you teach like that.

00:58:43.089 --> 00:58:44.729
Stay true to the duty of an academy.

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.589
What is it?

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.530
Isn't it to be repetitive and drill in the basics?

00:58:50.769 --> 00:58:53.300
Send lots of kids to med school and make yourself known.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.899
Don't you want to be a landlord?

00:58:57.709 --> 00:58:59.109
- I do. - Right.

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:02.839
Also...

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:04.850
Literature,

00:59:05.479 --> 00:59:07.850
history, the arts, and philosophy.

00:59:08.749 --> 00:59:10.519
You shouldn't teach that stuff in detail.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:14.119
I ended up like this, a history major, because it was...

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.589
the major my KSAT scores allowed.

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.830
Don't get anyone interested in that stuff.

00:59:20.359 --> 00:59:21.899
What do you mean you're "like this?"

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.700
It's like... Yes.

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.939
Even when I feel like ordering delivery like this,

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.569
I shudder when I think of the bill.

00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.370
I'm a poor student of humanities.

00:59:34.709 --> 00:59:35.740
A surplus human?

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:38.479
Yes. Dregs of society?

00:59:41.819 --> 00:59:43.379
Why do you talk like that?

00:59:46.689 --> 00:59:48.160
If everyone...

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:51.160
treats studying like the people do here,

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.030
the world would collapse.

00:59:54.229 --> 00:59:56.628
- What? - Studying because it's worth it...

00:59:56.629 --> 00:59:58.169
helped us grow as a society.

00:59:59.069 --> 01:00:01.740
Why talk like that when you're a scholar yourself?

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:03.499
That's pathetic.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.910
What?

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:13.810
Why was Si Woo so drawn to you and Mr. Lee?

01:00:14.919 --> 01:00:15.979
I want to know.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:21.819
Your free lecture.

01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:24.830
I liked and enjoyed it too,

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.030
but it had nothing to do with improving grades.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.229
I think so too,

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.970
but does it really have nothing to do with grades?

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.370
I'm not so sure.

01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:44.580
Promise to tell me if you find the answer.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.470
Can I ask why you keep stealing my bed?

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.879
Hey. Give me her number.

01:01:16.209 --> 01:01:17.550
That instructor.

01:01:18.249 --> 01:01:20.180
I could've beat her if I hadn't been drinking.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.249
Go to sleep.

01:01:26.819 --> 01:01:28.459
What a punk.

Where's Ms. Nam?

01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:00.019
She felt bedsores forming on her bottom.

01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:01.890
She went out for a walk.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.560
- Are you okay? - My bottom?

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.330
You saw it for yourself last...

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.899
Don't.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.970
- Have you lost your mind? - I won't talk.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.370
Darn you.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.140
How was it?

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:19.169
Okay.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.909
You look amazing in suits because you're tall and slim.

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:27.479
You don't look at all like the man who came in.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.419
Will you take this one?

01:02:30.919 --> 01:02:31.919
Yes.

01:02:32.689 --> 01:02:33.919
- I'll pay. - Okay.

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.060
(Century Store)

01:02:46.899 --> 01:02:48.370
The director said...

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:51.939
you're invited to dinner if you're free.

01:02:52.939 --> 01:02:56.839
I'm sorry, but I have plans today.

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:00.180
I'll pass it on,

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.649
Vice-director.

01:03:06.519 --> 01:03:07.519
No.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:10.720
I haven't yet resigned.

01:03:11.229 --> 01:03:12.459
That title is inappropriate.

01:03:13.729 --> 01:03:16.499
Plus, you're a TA.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.229
You don't have to act like my assistant.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.539
No, sir. I should and will, Vice-director.

01:03:27.339 --> 01:03:28.979
Where are you going next?

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.640
I'll drive you.

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.550
I apologize.

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:35.950
Can you take these for me instead?

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:40.019
Be sure to mention this.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.518
This bit of grammar was added after the textbooks were revised.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:45.260
Check the teachers' answers after each exam.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.660
Let's see the reading section.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.560
You tend to underestimate the kids' standards and levels.

01:03:51.169 --> 01:03:52.899
It's different from when you were a student.

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:56.669
I don't underestimate them. I'm helping cement the basics.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:58.910
Open the file.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.149
Don't you regret it?

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.850
Regret what?

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.418
You'd have gotten a promotion this year...

01:04:13.419 --> 01:04:14.660
if you'd kept your job.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.789
Assistant Manager Lee Jun Ho.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.760
I prefer being called a teacher.

01:04:26.999 --> 01:04:28.300
Hello, Ji Eun.

01:04:29.669 --> 01:04:31.209
Yes, I'm at work.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.740
I don't have a consultation today.

01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:40.050
I don't it's a consultation.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.519
He said you'd know the name Pyo Sang Seob.

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:28.499
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

01:05:30.729 --> 01:05:32.370
I will work at Choisun Academy.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.469
What did you just say?

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:36.039
Wasn't it a rumor that you wanted?

01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:37.939
For no one but yourself.

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:39.740
It's because of me.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:41.280
I want to turn back time.

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.208
It's just a phone number.

01:05:43.209 --> 01:05:45.050
She's not at all interested in you.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.079
Don't you wish for failure in case...

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.018
we steal your Chanyoung High students?

01:05:49.019 --> 01:05:50.780
Good luck. Go for it.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:54.318
Ms. Seo is strong and capable enough.

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:55.589
She is strong.

01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:57.620
But strong people get hurt too.

01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:59.430
I still want to be with you.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:00.930
I'll just be next to you.
