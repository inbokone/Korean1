00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.180
You haven't paid the rent in three months and 10 days.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.560
You haven't paid for the water in two months, and the utility bill-

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.300
Enough. That's enough, Grandma.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.690
You must've written down how much you spent on my snacks as a kid.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.070
Of course. I wrote down how much I spent on a pencil, too.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.690
I'll make sure you pay me back until the day I die.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.890
Are you sure I'm your biological granddaughter?

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.770
Gosh, I'll die while paying off my debt at this rate.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.820
What did you do with your watch?

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.010
The watch? It broke, so I'm getting it repaired.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.720
Aren't you interested in removing that scar?

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.200
They say medical technology improved a lot these days.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.070
Why would I remove it?

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.340
It's a mark that says I survived alone.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.280
By the way, Madam So, your tteokbokki business...

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.150
You need help since you sell out all the time.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.050
So, I was thinking...

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.780
should I try selling tteokbokki, too?

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.320
You little.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.480
- It' hurts, Grandma.
- You've got to be kidding right now.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.470
I made you a prosecutor selling tteokbokki.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.330
But you quit for some reason.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.180
If I invested the money I spent on you in stocks,

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.890
I'd be rich by now.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.830
Give me that, you brat.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.420
Madam So, wait for me, please?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.670
Mr. Seo, how's this one?

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.460
Is it too casual?

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.440
H-How about this?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.930
Why is there nothing to wear?

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.090
Even if you were naked, that woman wouldn't see you, anyway.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:29.520
But the attitude is important.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.670
Why is it so dusty?

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.030
When was the last time you cleaned?

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.120
By the way, why are you working so hard?

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.370
You aren't usually like this.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.780
This might be the last chance God's giving me, right?

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.590
Father.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.970
Brothers, please help me.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.020
I have a...

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.030
I-I-I have a video.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.540
Holy Father.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.240
[Shinil Catholic Church]

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.490
Is someone back there?

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.700
Okay, listen.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.700
The church will be empty until tomorrow afternoon because of a funeral.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.110
It'd be better to go to the priest's office

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.460
through the back door in the afternoon rather than at night.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.900
Good luck, both of you.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.250
Pardon?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.550
You need to come with us, Mr. Baek.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.810
I was a violent crime unit detective, after all.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.170
I can't break the law.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.510
- I'm off now.
- Pardon?

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.060
Pardon?

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.760
Is it okay for me to break the law, then?

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.010
What kind of newbie picks and chooses?

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.260
Hey, Baek Nam Goo!

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.760
You...

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.280
had better stop acting up.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.600
Once you get caught,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.130
he removes all the moisture in your body.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.820
He's the legendary "spin-dryer" police officer.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.520
Detective.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:52.030
He's Detective Baek.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.350
W-Well...

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.280
W-What's the difference once you're dead?

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.020
I'm a senior in terms of being a ghost.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.690
You're dead.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.040
Oh, I'm dead.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.100
Ma'am.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.760
My son says he really wants to eat your tteokbokki today.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.980
Could we get some to go?

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.960
You're a little too late.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.530
Make sure to come tomorrow.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.070
I'll set some aside for Yeong Ho, then.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.300
Come on, I know it's back there.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.120
I know you set some aside for Bom.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.540
She doesn't have time to eat because she's busy. You can't take hers.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.320
What do you mean, she's busy?

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.190
The whole neighborhood knows she's a jobless bum.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.950
What?

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.260
Who said such nonsense?

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.550
Ma'am, Bom didn't quit her job as a prosecutor.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.720
She got fired.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.730
My brother-in-law worked at the same Prosecutors' Office.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:07.290
She apparently got fired because she upset a very important prosecutor there.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.060
That's why the law firms won't hire her, either, because they don't want to offend him.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.320
What...

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.520
I'll leave. Let us buy some tomorrow.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.700
Come to the studio when the sun sets.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.720
I'll show you the world I live in.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.450
You came.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.750
Here are the photos of the visitors for the past hundred years.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.690
The photo studio existed for a hundred years?

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:55.500
Hold on. Are these photos of ghosts, then?

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.590
Yoon Dal is a human, and Yoon Hae is a ghost.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.630
This is a space that connects the living and the dead.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.860
And my job is to open the door for them.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:14.400
Unless I let them in, no living person can come in here.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.510
But I came in.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.790
That's why you're special.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.620
You're the only one who can come in here without my permission.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.200
You came.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.290
I told you not to do stuff like this.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.830
He said he was introduced to you once.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.010
Me?

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.610
We finally meet, Bom.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.930
This is meant to be.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.270
Meant to be, my foot. You never got to meet her.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.050
We might not have met, but...

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.890
we exchanged countless messages.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.190
We planned to watch "Crash Landing on You" together, too.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.540
They're real flowers.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.250
What would you like to drink?

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.160
Iced Americano? Hot Americano?

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.560
We have decaf, too.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.530
What would you like to drink?

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.120
Oh, this is Mr. Baek.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.050
He guards the photo studio.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.150
But of course, you don't see him.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.500
Please relay my message now!

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.670
Okay.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:32.530
Well, I heard you said you liked Hyun Bin.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.890
I've never been on a blind date.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.980
And I prefer Won Bin over Hyun Bin.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.660
He must be mistaken.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.230
By the way, are you sure there are ghosts here?

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.440
That can't be.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.180
Try to remember.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.920
How about the countless messages we exchanged?

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.920
We spent countless nights together.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.510
W-What was that just now?

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.400
Don't worry about it. Come this way.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.450
Tea cookies...

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.950
Mr. Baek, it hurts too much.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.140
Oh, Mr. Baek, Mr. Baek! You're lifting me up, too!

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.840
Mr. Baek. Mr. Baek!

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.100
Put me down, Mr. Baek.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.810
Sorry.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.900
I'm not good at controlling my strength yet. Aigoo, aigoo.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.910
You'll pay for this, Baek Nam Goo.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.470
What's this place actually for?

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:09.500
Like I said, I photograph the dead people for their last memory.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.840
You really see dead people?

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.830
I've been seeing ghosts since I was a kid.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.660
They've always chased me, trying to kill me.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.360
Why do they try to kill you?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.760
I mean, if you're actually a photographer for the dead,

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.150
I think I'd be grateful.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.370
The photo studio isn't open to all dead people.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.650
So the ghosts who couldn't come here

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:47.840
try to kill me to steal the camera with a mysterious power.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.630
I've never gone outside feeling comfortable.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.790
Riding a car, going to a movie,

00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:00.340
or eating with someone can't be done.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.470
Because I don't know when they'd come to kill me.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.900
Hold on. You're leaving me alone in this dangerous place?

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:14.030
That's why I need you.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.220
Your circle, to be exact.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.790
I won't be here for long.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.420
It'd be just a hundred days.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.430
I want you to protect me for just a hundred days.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.350
I'll return the rooftop unit to you after that.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.620
Hey, hey!

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.000
Why are you two hiding, exactly?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.830
This is a sacred place. You never know.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.620
God is watching everything.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:25.910
You're aware of that, and yet you had a video like that?

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.480
Amen.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.560
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.520
Let's go.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.110
Okay. Close the door. Close the door.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.370
- The door.
- Come on.

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.060
I'll just close it.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.800
[Peter]

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.050
You don't have fingerprints. What's the password?

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.960
Password.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:08.380
Well, I've only been using my f-fingerprint.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.440
I know. What could the password be?

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.240
Think carefully, Father.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.660
I feel like I could remember it...

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.230
I-I'm sorry.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.230
- I'm sorry.
- You must have a few options.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.420
Tell me one of them.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.740
Well, it can't be my military service number. Is it my old address?

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.980
Maria?

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.140
P-People are coming!

And we met at the police station again regarding the priest.
