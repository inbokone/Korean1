Aigoo, you have watched too many period dramas.

An important event, my foot.

She has been wanting to marry Yoon Bok since she took her first step.

I can see so many stars from here.

She wishes to have a fashion show in Seongsan Village.

What are you planning to do?

00:54:46.279 --> 00:54:50.589
I cannot put the village in danger again.

00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:57.095
Se Ryeong stopped by earlier.

00:54:57.119 --> 00:55:00.969
Should you not consider getting married soon?

00:55:05.209 --> 00:55:07.875
She turned out proper and gentle.

00:55:07.899 --> 00:55:10.505
She knows how to care for major family events

00:55:10.529 --> 00:55:13.445

Stop harassing me.
