That means he's done flirting.

166
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,430
Case closed. The end.

167
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,400
You gave me a ghost-repellent kit before, right?

168
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes, do you need more?

169
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,750
Is that ghost still attached to you?

170
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,490
I don't want that.

171
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,690
Is there something that draws ghosts in?

172
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,950
Something that traps them so they can't run away.

173
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,920
What are you saying?

174
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,980
You don't have one, right?

175
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,580
Okay, done.

176
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,120
By the way, where have you been?

177
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,720
I went to where my parents had an accident. That tunnel.

178
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,730
By the way, I don't think the accident was just a normal accident.

179
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,530
- What?
- Anyway, things might get noisy for a while.

180
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,890
I only waited for him to come home every day.

181
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,430

190

You can't do that.

Oppa, we need to talk.

You can't leave because you're mad at me, right?

199
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,040
Do you hate me that much?

200

Enough for you to take all of our stuff?

201
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,450
I actually don't like flowers.

202
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,360
But there are tons of them everywhere.

203
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,980
Our building's garden has them

204
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,330
and the park we used to frequent has them.

205
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,530
Your police station's garden has them, too.

206
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,220
I'm sure they are also in the neighborhoods where you've been chasing culprits.

207
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,580
That's why I said I liked them.

208
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,110
I thought you might text me back if you saw those flowers everywhere.

209

It's true I'm a bitch.

If only I didn't say I needed to talk to you then...

211
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,290
Is it because you resent that?

212
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,280
Or are you worried I'd choose that man?

213

I won't. I can't.

214

I'll be punished properly.

215

I can't dare expect to be happy after killing you.

216

Yes. As Mr. Kim's family, you have access to the vacation home murder file and

235
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,470
his death record from three years ago.

I'm thinking of requesting information for the Jangjin Tunnel case, too.

I think all of these cases are related.

Oh, you should read the foreign theses.

there's no guarantee it can lift the curse.

And you said you read this over ten times.

Just stay. I'm recharging.

Can I borrow the studio journal?

I can lend it to you, but why?

You must've written about me in there, too.

I thought I might remember something if I read your journal.

519

Is it childish?

Why did you harass me so much, then?

Well... I didn't mean to.

I know.

540
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,860
You didn't want another person to die like you on that seat.

541

So, you kicked them out, right?

How did you know?

Because someone who wants to secure a position

544
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,150
doesn't worry about other people hurting.

But the funny thing is...

I'm at my happiest now.

549
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,480
I never became a deputy. I'm unemployed,
