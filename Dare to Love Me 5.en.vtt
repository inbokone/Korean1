00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.557
Yoon Bok!

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:37.867
I missed you, Yoon Bok.

00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:44.193
How dare you come to this place?

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:45.587
Me?

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:49.387
I came to live with you, of course.

00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:52.577
What did you...

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:55.453
say just now?

00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:57.857
I said I'm going to live with you.

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:06.063
Teacher, I am sorry, but I will go inside now.

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:09.157
Okay, go ahead.

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:16.477
Follow me.

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:36.997
[Episode 5: What's Wrong With My Heart?]

00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:01.483
Who was that?

00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:02.837
Me?

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:06.513
I came to live with you, of course.

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:10.677
Who is she that she wants to live with him?

00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:28.883
I was contacted by the one who cut ties and left a long time ago.

00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:30.677
Could she be...

00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:33.157
Nah...

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:38.547
Are you...

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:42.267
abandoning me?

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:45.293
She abandoned Yoon Bok.

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:47.463
His ex-girlfriend?

00:02:47.487 --> 00:02:52.683
How dare you say you'd live with me?

00:02:52.707 --> 00:02:54.397
Yoon Bok.

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:59.343
You became so handsome while I hadn't seen you.

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:01.273
You're totally a heartbreaker now.

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:04.947
Look at your shoulders. And you're so tall-

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.813
I do not even want to share a moment with you.

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:12.067
Please leave immediately.

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:16.437
I don't want to.

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:22.323
I'm sorry, but I won't leave even if you tell me to.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.453
I'll live here with you.

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:26.373
Do you have any conscience?

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:28.077
You...

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.383
live with someone already.

00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:33.817
Who?

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:36.337
Mom?

00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:39.763
Gosh, whatever.

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.393
I have nowhere else to go, anyway.

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:46.387
I have no home, lodging, or job. I'm unemployed.

00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:56.513
Whether you have a place to go or not does not concern me.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.663
I will step out. You should be gone when I return.

00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.817
If you are still here,

00:04:04.337 --> 00:04:06.657
I will not forgive you.

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:19.507
Three.

00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.543
Four.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.337
Five.

00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:26.893
Six.

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:28.837
Seven.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.497
Eight.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:35.127
Nine.

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:04.723
I thought I would never see her again.

00:05:04.747 --> 00:05:06.987
Why did she come here?

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:12.023
I wish she left me alone...

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:14.807
as she has been doing all this time.

00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:29.723
She came wanting to live with him.

00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:33.483
They must've been very close.

00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:37.207
Huh? That's not your mouth.

00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:43.083
I suppose Yoon Bok is an adult, too.

00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:44.643
It's understandable.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:49.447
By chance, is there a woman you have feelings for?

00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:55.553
I will tell you when the time comes.

00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:58.813
Please do not worry about my marriage so much.

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:02.073
Marriage? Marriage?

00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:03.743
- Brother.
- Yes?

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:06.423
Do you know anything about Yoon Bok's ex?

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:09.173
Yoon Bok has an ex?

00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:13.167
- Who is she?
- Don't you know anything about your friend?

00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:16.673
Hold on.

00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:19.113
That's why!

00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:21.103
Gosh, that was it.

00:06:21.127 --> 00:06:23.343
What? Why? What do you mean?

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:25.143
Yoon Bok wanted to go to the club.

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.683
I thought it was too out of the blue,

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:32.457
but he was trying to get over his ex.

00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:37.797
But since he stopped wanting to go since then,

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:40.543
he must have...

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:44.997
met a new girlfriend to make him forget his ex completely.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:48.713
Or...

00:06:48.737 --> 00:06:51.337
the ex came back.

00:06:52.527 --> 00:06:56.887
"Yoon Bok, should we get back together?"

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:00.643
I'm such an imaginative artist.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:04.483
Wow, how could they not recognize how talented I am?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.883
They'll regret firing me someday.

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:10.157
What? Did you get fired?

00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:16.127
I wanted to cut that scene early for some reason.

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:23.607
[The end]

00:07:29.037 --> 00:07:33.767
Kim Hong Hak!

00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:36.617
Is he out of his mind?

00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:40.777
Is this old man out of his mind?

00:07:46.017 --> 00:07:48.503
"It has been a long while, Maiden.

00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:52.523
I was very surprised to hear from you."

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:54.733
Have you been well?

00:07:54.757 --> 00:07:57.353
I have been doing well without any issues.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.973
Unfortunately,

00:07:59.997 --> 00:08:03.493
I will not be able to accept your request.

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:09.283
I am very sincerely sorry about that.

00:08:09.307 --> 00:08:10.513
Sincerely, Shin Soo Geun.

00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.263
My goodness.

00:08:12.287 --> 00:08:15.743
There's a human who says no to the mighty Camille...

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:18.573
on this entire earth.

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.823
You're rejecting my request?

00:08:20.847 --> 00:08:22.533
I'm sorry.

00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:24.133
I should've done a better job.

00:08:24.157 --> 00:08:26.243
Stop!

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:27.883
Hong Do Kim?

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:30.583
You promised not to bow down for no reason.

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:33.873
And Camille's employee doesn't get discouraged over something so small.

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:37.607
So, don't be down, okay?

00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:40.347
Okay.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:53.843
Young Master, is something going on?

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.367
You look upset.

00:08:57.857 --> 00:09:00.303
It is nothing.

00:09:00.327 --> 00:09:03.543
Should I take you home if you are feeling ill?

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:05.533
At home...

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:10.703
I'm sorry, but I won't leave even if you told me to.

00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:13.803
I'll live here with you.

00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:15.793
I will go home on my own for a while.

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:18.733
Just focus on the investigation.

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:20.127
- Okay.
- Wow.

00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:28.693
I looked up all Kim Chil Boks in the country, but no one looked like the sketch.

00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:32.303
He either has a fake name, got plastic surgery,

00:09:32.327 --> 00:09:34.937
or he's a ghost. It's one of those three.

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:40.483
Contact Yeojudaek and ask if she noticed anything suspicious about him.

00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:41.817
Okay.

00:10:22.547 --> 00:10:26.987
He is definitely hiding something.

00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:53.393
Ma'am, are you out of Lecker Beer?

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:55.113
Oh, that?

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:59.297
Some lady just bought all of it earlier.

00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:25.907
Thank you.

00:11:32.787 --> 00:11:35.227
I wonder if she left.

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.827
Yoon Bok!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:57.167
Teacher, do not run. You might end up falling.

00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:01.803
Did you just get here?

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:03.353
Yes.

00:12:03.377 --> 00:12:06.153
Looks like you are on your way back from work, too.

00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:07.747
Yes.

00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:15.983
How was your day today?

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:18.377
Did anything happen in particular?

00:12:19.777 --> 00:12:22.427
Of course, it did.

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:28.543
Your grandfather's letter caused a big uproar.

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:33.577
But Camille wasn't discouraged at all.

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:37.363
That's why she's my role model.

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:41.623
Do you respect her that much?

00:12:41.647 --> 00:12:43.047
Yes.

00:12:48.437 --> 00:12:50.413
How about you, Yoon Bok?

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.887
You must've gone through a lot today.

00:12:54.627 --> 00:12:58.457
I cannot make her worry again.

00:13:00.917 --> 00:13:03.933
No, not much happened.

00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:05.407
Really?

00:13:07.427 --> 00:13:10.403
Who was the person who came by this morning?

00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:12.623
She had a big bag.

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:14.437
She is...

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:22.277
She's not someone you should worry about.

00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:34.553
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

00:13:34.577 --> 00:13:36.463
Should we go?

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:37.837
Yes.

00:13:44.287 --> 00:13:46.217
Yoon Bok!

00:13:53.257 --> 00:13:57.907
Teacher, I am sorry, but I will leave now.

00:13:59.497 --> 00:14:01.397
Well, but...

00:14:06.817 --> 00:14:10.257
My gosh, what's happening?

00:14:27.387 --> 00:14:29.273
Why are you still here?

00:14:29.297 --> 00:14:30.773
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:33.093
Let's eat together. Have a seat.

00:14:33.117 --> 00:14:36.823
It's mostly the side dishes in the fridge, but...

00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:38.903
By the way, who made these for you?

00:14:38.927 --> 00:14:41.437
I can tell it wasn't Yeojudaek.

00:14:44.177 --> 00:14:46.673
I warned you, did I not?

00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:50.693
I said I would not forgive you if you were still here.

00:14:50.717 --> 00:14:53.923
I told you, too. I have no place to go.

00:14:53.947 --> 00:14:58.573
If you don't let me stay, I have to sleep out on the streets.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:02.563
So you can drag me out, hurt me,

00:15:02.587 --> 00:15:06.463
or do whatever. I won't leave on my own.

00:15:06.487 --> 00:15:07.843
Whatever.

00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:09.513
How shameless.

00:15:09.537 --> 00:15:11.473
Get up immediately.

00:15:11.497 --> 00:15:13.767
Get up right now!

00:15:14.877 --> 00:15:16.607
You really are...

00:15:17.657 --> 00:15:21.737
the only one I have right now.

00:15:25.237 --> 00:15:28.707
- Here.
- Wow, looks tasty!

00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:32.693
Wow.

00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:34.643
I am the best, am I not?

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.207
Yes.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.703
I need to yell at her to leave now.

00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:47.523
But why...

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:50.487
Why can I not move my lips?

00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:56.523
Stay as if you are not here.

00:15:56.547 --> 00:15:59.013
Try to be out of sight as much as you can.

00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:03.083
And find a place to stay quickly and leave.

00:16:03.107 --> 00:16:05.447
This is the best I can do for you.

00:16:12.937 --> 00:16:15.077
Thank you, Yoon Bok!

00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:37.213
Yes, Camille designer doesn't get discouraged over stuff like this.

00:16:37.237 --> 00:16:39.203
Don't be down!

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:43.747
I'll just check what their relationship is myself.

00:16:56.637 --> 00:17:00.417
Geez, I know nothing about the strong woman.

00:17:01.397 --> 00:17:03.857
I need more information.

00:17:08.017 --> 00:17:09.507
Or...

00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:12.763
I need more protein.

00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:16.507
I'll pretend like I'm bringing him fruit.

00:17:17.647 --> 00:17:21.097
What? Where did all the fruit go?

00:17:24.197 --> 00:17:25.453
Who are you?

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:27.587
Show me your face.

00:17:31.037 --> 00:17:33.293
- Noona?
- Did you eat all the fruit in here?

00:17:33.317 --> 00:17:37.067
Well, that? There wasn't that much, anyway.

00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:48.293
I had to eat to come up with a new project.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:51.643
I'm creating something unbelievable right now.

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:57.383
Noona, you know artists give birth to work by going through pain, right?

00:17:57.407 --> 00:18:01.063
Since we're on the topic, can you order me fried chicken?

00:18:01.087 --> 00:18:02.413
Half and half.

00:18:02.437 --> 00:18:03.983
What? Fried chicken?

00:18:04.007 --> 00:18:05.837
Are you out of your mind-

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.977
Order it right now.

00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:13.627
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.513
Aigoo,

00:18:17.537 --> 00:18:21.597
Mr. Chicken came to this crummy place.

00:18:22.827 --> 00:18:27.177
I will take you to my mouth immediately.

00:18:32.017 --> 00:18:34.703
Don't you know the one-leg per-person rule?

00:18:34.727 --> 00:18:36.133
You can't eat two.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:39.543
- How come you have no sense of loyalty?
- Huh?

00:18:39.567 --> 00:18:43.203
Don't you think about your friend when you're eating this delicious fried chicken?

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:44.917
All of a sudden?

00:18:46.757 --> 00:18:48.223
Hold on.

00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:49.543
Are you taking that to Yoon Bok?

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:53.143
Go ahead and eat. I'll share some with him.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:55.377
Noona, seriously.

00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:04.457
Give me my leg! Give it to me!

00:19:44.207 --> 00:19:45.867
Could it be...

00:19:49.787 --> 00:19:52.093
Aigoo, what do we do?

00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:54.233
He must be already in bed.

00:19:54.257 --> 00:19:56.123
It's not even 10 yet.

00:19:56.147 --> 00:19:58.833
It'd be rude to wake him up.

00:19:58.857 --> 00:20:03.377
We'll have to eat the chicken ourselves, right?

00:20:12.627 --> 00:20:16.543
Our fate was cut off a long time ago.

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:22.247
No. He definitely said their fate was cut off long ago.

00:20:27.297 --> 00:20:31.877
Shall we rekindle that fate today?

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:52.957
No, Yoon Bok is a nobleman. There's no way.

00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:15.467
I'm sorry.

00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:19.791
I spilled some beer by mistake.

00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:56.347
What? Where?

00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:57.857
I'm in Seongsan Village right now.

00:21:57.881 --> 00:21:59.697
I came to see him in person.

00:21:59.721 --> 00:22:02.067
How could you tell me that now?

00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:04.147
Run over here if you're scared.

00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:05.837
See you then.

00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.631
Well, I-

00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.321
Gosh, seriously.

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.667
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:20.827
I'm seeing my ex in 46 years.

00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:23.787
It'd be weird to bring someone else.

00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:27.707
I'll be in the area. Call me if something happens.

00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:29.251
Okay.

00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:55.927
Open the gate, please.

00:22:55.951 --> 00:22:59.241
W-Who's this? Who are you?

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:03.757
Tell Soo Geun...

00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.581
that I, Camille, am here.

00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:10.801
What? Who's here?

00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:27.581
[Woorim House]

00:23:59.641 --> 00:24:01.371
Bonjour.

00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:08.987
Gosh, how could she dress up so flashy?

00:24:09.011 --> 00:24:10.817
Aigoo!

00:24:10.841 --> 00:24:13.171
Let us go.

00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:18.231
Excuse me, where's Woorim House?

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.037
That way.

00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:22.771
Merci.

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:28.281
What a strange scarf she is wearing.

00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:14.781
I think I found the most beautiful view in Paris.

00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:24.141
I cannot see Paris since its beauty was overwhelmed by yours.

00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:00.421
Oops.

00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:07.071
Sorry, Mr. Shin.

00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.781
It is okay.

00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:19.651
Long time no see, Maiden Bok Soon.

00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:24.407
Maiden, my foot.

00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:26.511
I'm too old for that.

00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:58.437
Where did this man go?

00:26:58.461 --> 00:27:00.907
What if someone sees him?

00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:04.081
Geez. Seriously...

00:27:10.841 --> 00:27:12.467
Aigoo, you came, Director.

00:27:12.491 --> 00:27:14.537
Yes. Where is he?

00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:16.861
You mean, Master?

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:29.537
You chose this over me 46 years ago.

00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:32.691
I can see why. I'll admit it.

00:27:34.871 --> 00:27:36.487
What brings you all the way here?

00:27:36.511 --> 00:27:40.297
I already expressed my position in the letter.

00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:43.777
Seeing it myself makes me glad that I...

00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:46.321
tore off that letter.

00:27:49.931 --> 00:27:52.127
You told me 46 years ago...

00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:55.121
that you'd open it once in your life.

00:27:56.481 --> 00:27:58.877
I said I'll open my heart.

00:27:58.901 --> 00:28:02.427
I never said I'd open up the village.

00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:06.851
I don't need your heart. Open up your village instead.

00:28:06.881 --> 00:28:08.427
- It is not possible.
- Please open it.

00:28:08.451 --> 00:28:10.877
- I cannot.
- Open it!

00:28:10.901 --> 00:28:12.947
I said I cannot.

00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:16.987
How come you're always so stubborn?

00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:19.671
Stubborn?

00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:24.787
I may be stubborn, but I am not unreasonable.

00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:28.281
- You are the one who is being stubborn!
- Ha!
- Ha!

00:28:33.971 --> 00:28:35.487
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:28:35.511 --> 00:28:36.947
I am glad you are here.

00:28:36.971 --> 00:28:38.157
Why do you not tell me?

00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:41.297
Am I stubborn?

00:28:41.321 --> 00:28:44.941
- Pardon?
- Yes, be honest.

00:28:47.981 --> 00:28:52.507
You just care about the village a lot.

00:28:52.531 --> 00:28:55.317
Hey! You told me before!

00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:58.527
That no one can change his mind!

00:28:58.551 --> 00:29:01.277
No, it's not that! No, sir...

00:29:01.301 --> 00:29:05.607
Director Lee, get this woman out of the village immediately.

00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:06.857
What?

00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:11.317
Before I make Chief Gatekeeper force her out! Hurry!

00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:12.911
Okay.

00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:26.407
I let you go back then because...

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:30.197
I respected your brand, Seongsan Village.

00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:32.127
It might not be as old as yours,

00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:35.257
but my brand has tradition and value, too.

00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:38.287
I thought you'd respect that.

00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:42.467
I think I overestimated you.

00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:45.301
I am sorry to disappoint you.

00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:52.287
You can't just barge in like this.

00:29:52.311 --> 00:29:54.317
You should've taken the proper steps through me-

00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:56.387
Convince me with proper steps now.

00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:59.157
Otherwise, I'll use the final solution.

00:29:59.181 --> 00:30:01.127
What? Final solution?

00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:02.547
What's that?

00:30:02.571 --> 00:30:04.921
Frankie, where are you?

00:30:15.231 --> 00:30:18.347
Young Mater, I am in front of your place. I will come up briefly.

00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:20.081
You cannot.

00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:25.621
I will come down. Stay right there

00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:29.521
Well, okay.

00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:36.971
Young Master is enforcing boundaries these days.

00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:43.301
Are you going somewhere?

00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:46.071
Yoon Bok.

00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:54.877
- Young Master.
- What is this about?

00:30:54.901 --> 00:30:57.797
I think I need to stop by the village.

00:30:57.821 --> 00:30:59.627
I was contacted by Yeojudaek.

00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:02.677
She says Kim Chil Bok is acting suspiciously.

00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:04.537
In what way?

00:31:04.561 --> 00:31:08.801
He sometimes leaves the room secretly, apparently.

00:31:12.181 --> 00:31:15.007
I will go to the village. You can leave now.

00:31:15.031 --> 00:31:16.727
- Pardon?
- Leave now, I said.

00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:19.707
And contact me at the convenience store from now on.

00:31:19.731 --> 00:31:23.047
Pardon? Young Master, how could you be like this-

00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:24.797
Come on. There is no time for this.

00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:28.017
Hurry up and look into the case 17 years ago or the evidence of Gamjjok or whatever.

00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:30.201
- Okay.
- Hurry.

00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:41.801
Yoon Bok.

00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:47.651
Yoon Bok, where are you going?

00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:52.527
Just wait a moment.

00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:54.901
I'll change your mind.

00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:00.131
Over here!

00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:13.221
Yoon Bok.

00:32:14.401 --> 00:32:16.331
Yoon Bok!

00:32:26.201 --> 00:32:28.917
Why does...

00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:31.561
it keep feeling painful here?

00:32:49.661 --> 00:32:53.161
I have no appetite these days.

00:32:57.201 --> 00:32:59.431
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:03.847
We can't break up, okay?

00:33:03.871 --> 00:33:06.781
Promise to never do that again.

00:33:10.561 --> 00:33:13.961
My heart aches as if I got shot.

00:33:15.331 --> 00:33:22.337
♫ I'm sorry I keep feeling scared ♫

00:33:22.361 --> 00:33:28.477
♫ I'm afraid we'd end up breaking up ♫

00:33:28.501 --> 00:33:36.007
♫ I don't want to believe this is the end, but ♫

00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:39.507
My heart skips a beat whenever I look up in the sky.

00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.521
What's wrong with me?

00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:45.297
By chance...

00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:47.731
Am I sick or something?

00:33:50.951 --> 00:33:54.911
[Heart skipping a beat]

00:33:56.131 --> 00:34:00.177
Your symptom makes me suspect arrhythmia or other heart conditions.

00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:01.961
Arrhythmia?

00:34:08.071 --> 00:34:10.321
Hello!

00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:22.141
Hello.

00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:24.391
Hello.

00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:29.217
You're the one who was with Yoon Bok yesterday, right?

00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:30.931
Yes.

00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:36.801
By the way, who are you?

00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:43.007
Do I have to answer that?

00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:44.247
Pardon?

00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:49.491
Pardon?
Right, their relationship is none of my business.

00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:56.581
- How about you? Who are you?
- Well...

00:34:58.051 --> 00:35:00.797
I'm Yoon Bok's teacher, who lives next door...

00:35:00.821 --> 00:35:03.731
Why am I answering her question?

00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:07.237
You lived next door.

00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:10.057
That makes us neighbors.

00:35:10.081 --> 00:35:11.607
Neighbors?

00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.837
I'll be living here.

00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:17.591
With Yoon Bok.

00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:20.031
Yoon Bok...

00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:23.797
Together?

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:29.171
By chance, did you make the side dishes in his fridge?

00:35:31.111 --> 00:35:33.967
- Pardon?
- Vegetables and his other favorites.

00:35:33.991 --> 00:35:36.117
You made them in Seongsan Village style.

00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.487
It was you, wasn't it?

00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:41.077
Yes, I did, but...

00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:45.307
Thank you for taking care of him on my behalf.

00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:47.227
On her behalf?

00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:49.467
We're all done.

00:35:49.491 --> 00:35:52.601
See you again, Neighbor.

00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:57.567
I didn't take care of him on her behalf.

00:35:57.591 --> 00:35:59.671
I just cared for him.

00:36:04.511 --> 00:36:11.517
♫ I'm sorry I keep feeling scared ♫

00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:17.627
♫ I'm afraid we'd end up breaking up ♫

00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:25.987
♫ I don't want to believe this is the end, but ♫

00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:31.241
♫ I'm letting you go now ♫

00:36:50.867 --> 00:36:53.803
I want to dedicate this to you.

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:55.517
Really?

00:36:57.677 --> 00:37:00.227
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

00:37:14.787 --> 00:37:17.427
I'd like another refill.

00:37:18.357 --> 00:37:22.363
I found a killer material, I said.

00:37:22.387 --> 00:37:23.623
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

00:37:23.647 --> 00:37:26.523
Come on. Don't say no without even seeing it.

00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:29.573
Just once. Please look at it just once.

00:37:29.597 --> 00:37:31.743
Please.

00:37:31.767 --> 00:37:34.483
I can have a look at it,

00:37:34.507 --> 00:37:37.933
but the company has no faith in you.

00:37:37.957 --> 00:37:41.273
To be honest, your drawing skills aren't spectacular

00:37:41.297 --> 00:37:43.993
and your stories don't meet the MZers'* taste.
(Millenials and Gen Zers)

00:37:44.017 --> 00:37:46.723
It's always about men trying to act cool.

00:37:46.747 --> 00:37:48.453
You wanted an MZer style.

00:37:48.477 --> 00:37:50.103
I can do it. I'm an MZer myself.

00:37:50.127 --> 00:37:53.843
Passion only won't fix the issue.

00:37:53.867 --> 00:37:57.297
You need to have a natural talent, but...

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:02.687
We feel bad whenever we see hate comments. That's why.

00:38:06.057 --> 00:38:08.333
It'd be different this time. It's about the Joseon era...

00:38:08.357 --> 00:38:10.213
Here's your coffee.

00:38:10.237 --> 00:38:11.413
She kicks him like this...

00:38:11.437 --> 00:38:14.147
Okay, next time. Next time.

00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:16.877
Let's talk next time.

00:38:31.857 --> 00:38:34.757
Were you that hopeless of an artist?

00:38:35.807 --> 00:38:37.353
Yoon Ah!

00:38:37.377 --> 00:38:39.773
At the cafe earlier...

00:38:39.797 --> 00:38:41.217
Cafe...

00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:46.693
Oh, you heard everything.

00:38:46.717 --> 00:38:48.123
I just wasn't recognized yet.

00:38:48.147 --> 00:38:51.217
I tend to be a late bloomer.

00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:54.353
Will coffee be enough?

00:38:54.377 --> 00:38:55.563
Pardon?

00:38:55.587 --> 00:39:00.657
Looks like you need alcohol more than caffeine.

00:39:05.087 --> 00:39:06.687
Let us go.

00:39:17.367 --> 00:39:19.183
Why are people like that?

00:39:19.207 --> 00:39:21.943
Why do they leave comments? It's so hurtful.

00:39:21.967 --> 00:39:25.123
They do because they do not find it fun.

00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:27.403
Don't read it, then.

00:39:27.427 --> 00:39:31.293
Why get hurt by comments from strangers?

00:39:31.317 --> 00:39:35.063
I thought you were just physically weak,

00:39:35.087 --> 00:39:37.587
but are you weak in spirit, too?

00:39:38.967 --> 00:39:41.197
I don't want to admit it,

00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:44.777
but I guess I really have no talent.

00:39:45.777 --> 00:39:47.343
Do not blame yourself.

00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:51.597
You even get hurt by people's criticism. Why criticize yourself?

00:39:53.037 --> 00:39:55.283
Do not pour yourself a drink, either.

00:39:55.307 --> 00:39:58.363
You would prevent your company from dating for three years.

00:39:58.387 --> 00:40:00.977
Oh, sorry.

00:40:02.427 --> 00:40:05.673
You might be a weak man now,

00:40:05.697 --> 00:40:09.033
but you can become a strong man someday, too.

00:40:09.057 --> 00:40:10.757
Cheer up.

00:40:14.967 --> 00:40:16.993
You don't understand...

00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:20.307
how cruel this world is.

00:40:22.027 --> 00:40:25.217
Who says I do not?

00:40:26.737 --> 00:40:29.163
I have a lot of worries, too.

00:40:29.187 --> 00:40:31.403
I get hurt a lot, too.

00:40:31.427 --> 00:40:33.307
You do?

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:37.583
I always try my best,

00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:40.563
but I cannot tell how Young Master feels.

00:40:40.587 --> 00:40:44.647
No matter how devoted I am, he keeps a distance from me.

00:40:46.157 --> 00:40:48.163
Does Yoon Bok make you feel left out?

00:40:48.187 --> 00:40:50.983
The exceptional Young Master would not do that.

00:40:51.007 --> 00:40:55.557
I just blame my inability.

00:40:56.557 --> 00:40:59.013
Wow, what a bastard he is.

00:40:59.037 --> 00:41:00.473
Come on.

00:41:00.497 --> 00:41:03.637
Do not talk about Young Master that way.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:26.057
Just one moment. Just one moment.

00:41:27.287 --> 00:41:28.803
I posted the job ad forever ago.

00:41:28.827 --> 00:41:33.153
- Mr. Lee.
- Hello, sir. This way. Come on in.

00:41:33.177 --> 00:41:35.263
Go all the way in.

00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:39.407
Do you know what he said to that?

00:41:40.407 --> 00:41:42.843
"Do not cross the line!

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.997
Step back!"

00:41:47.737 --> 00:41:52.133
How is that different from hate comments?

00:41:52.157 --> 00:41:55.783
Do you know what people say?

00:41:55.807 --> 00:41:59.217
"Did you draw with your foot? Quit drawing."

00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:08.847
No matter what people say, I will post a positive comment to your series.

00:42:11.317 --> 00:42:13.703
No matter what Yoon Bok says,

00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:18.367
I will cheer for you, Yoon Ah.

00:42:19.527 --> 00:42:23.123
Good work, Oh Yoon Ah! Bravo!

- I'm sorry.
- Come on!

How have you been?

00:43:53.177 --> 00:43:56.963
Right, I did hear you became successful.

00:43:56.987 --> 00:44:00.397
I'm just running a small restaurant.

00:44:01.357 --> 00:44:05.863
By the way, what are you doing here?

00:44:05.887 --> 00:44:10.173

You're working part-time, My Lady?

00:44:14.147 --> 00:44:18.523
My Lady, my foot. I left the village a long time ago.

00:44:18.547 --> 00:44:20.303
And why else would I work part-time?

00:44:20.327 --> 00:44:22.397
I'm trying to make money.

00:44:24.527 --> 00:44:28.657
As you know, I don't have many skills.

Oh, hire me if you need a part-timer at the restaurant.

You saw it earlier, too.

you seduced my granddaughter and put her in this mess!

00:53:08.377 --> 00:53:10.673
Ex-girlfriend?

00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:12.963
He looked at you so intensely.

00:53:12.987 --> 00:53:15.493
So I was sure you were his ex.

00:53:15.517 --> 00:53:19.023
Thinking now, I was a bit biased.

00:53:19.047 --> 00:53:20.937
It's okay.

00:53:22.047 --> 00:53:24.583
By the way, how old are you, Hong Do?

00:53:24.607 --> 00:53:26.423
Well, I'm 30.

00:53:26.447 --> 00:53:29.207
Gosh, we're the same age.

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:34.403
We're the same age, and we like the same beer.

00:53:34.427 --> 00:53:38.273
Let me ask you. What do you like between jjajang and jjambbong?

00:53:38.297 --> 00:53:39.883
One, two, three.

00:53:39.907 --> 00:53:41.593
- Jjajang.
- Jjajang.

00:53:41.617 --> 00:53:44.923
Tangsuyuk. Pour or dip? One, two, three.

00:53:44.947 --> 00:53:47.523
- Pour.
- Pour. How unusual.

00:53:47.547 --> 00:53:49.283
The last one is about naengmyeon.

00:53:49.307 --> 00:53:51.713
Water or spicy. One, two, three.

00:53:51.737 --> 00:53:53.507
- Water.
- Water.

00:53:54.677 --> 00:53:57.133
Even our preferences match?

00:53:57.157 --> 00:53:58.743
I guess we could say...

00:53:58.767 --> 00:54:01.223
It's a destiny?

00:54:01.247 --> 00:54:03.293
- Should we be friends?
- Okay.

00:54:03.317 --> 00:54:05.043
Nice to meet you, friend.

00:54:05.067 --> 00:54:06.947
Cheers.

00:54:12.497 --> 00:54:15.873
Did you leave Seongsan Village with Yoon Bok, then?

00:54:15.897 --> 00:54:21.973
No, I left him behind and lived outside for a reason.

00:54:21.997 --> 00:54:26.833
That's why he's a bit angry at me right now.

00:54:26.857 --> 00:54:29.357
Oh, I see.

00:54:30.957 --> 00:54:35.683
By the way, you're very interested in him, Hong Do.

00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:37.057
Huh?

00:54:38.767 --> 00:54:44.363
No, it's because I was close to him as a student.

00:54:44.387 --> 00:54:47.583
He seems to rely on you a lot, too.

00:54:47.607 --> 00:54:49.357
He does?

00:54:50.257 --> 00:54:51.737
Me?

00:54:57.867 --> 00:55:01.967
To be honest, I went to see him sometimes.

00:55:16.277 --> 00:55:20.193
Hey, what's wrong with you? It's your fault...

00:55:20.217 --> 00:55:21.703
Why is he on his own?

00:55:21.727 --> 00:55:24.297
I don't know. Let's go.

00:55:27.197 --> 00:55:29.147
Hurry! Hurry!

00:55:34.217 --> 00:55:36.137
[Diploma - Doyeong High School]

00:55:39.287 --> 00:55:40.763
Congratulations.

00:55:40.787 --> 00:55:43.387
Let me buy you something tasty. What would you like?

00:55:48.097 --> 00:55:51.423
He was making the same face whenever I saw him.

00:55:51.447 --> 00:55:53.557
It broke my heart, but...

00:55:59.177 --> 00:56:00.513
Here.

00:56:00.537 --> 00:56:04.727
He was different whenever he was with you.

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.207
At least in front of you, he...

00:56:12.107 --> 00:56:14.367
didn't look sad anymore.

00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:18.813
- Really?
- Yes.

00:56:18.837 --> 00:56:21.813
Take good care of my brother from now on, too.

00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:25.603
He acts cold, but he's warm inside.

00:56:25.627 --> 00:56:29.247
He'll open up if you keep approaching him.

00:56:37.017 --> 00:56:38.447
Cheers.

00:56:49.927 --> 00:56:53.807
Why is this so easy to eat?

00:56:54.707 --> 00:56:57.053
Don't you know "Sweet-salty-sweet-salty"?

00:56:57.077 --> 00:57:01.027
You crave something sweet after eating something salty.

00:57:02.967 --> 00:57:06.407
Teacher likes this, too.

00:57:15.237 --> 00:57:18.853
So confusing. So confusing.

00:57:18.877 --> 00:57:22.113
Why? Why on earth?

00:57:22.137 --> 00:57:29.113
Why am I so happy that Yi Bok was Yoon Bok's sister?

00:57:29.137 --> 00:57:31.847
My heart doesn't ache anymore, either.

00:57:38.077 --> 00:57:41.427
By chance, do I like Yoon Bok?

00:58:01.457 --> 00:58:03.167
Yoon Bok!

00:58:22.737 --> 00:58:24.997
There goes my heart again.

00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:36.157
I think I like Yoon Bok.

♫ I've been picturing it in the sky ♫

[Epilogue]

00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:19.557
Do you know what love is?

00:59:21.447 --> 00:59:23.087
Love is...

00:59:24.067 --> 00:59:26.893
like a car accident, apparently.

00:59:26.917 --> 00:59:31.617
I think I got hit by a car.

00:59:32.467 --> 00:59:35.917
A car with Yoon Bok in it.

00:59:40.067 --> 00:59:41.807
My gosh!

00:59:51.247 --> 00:59:56.703
♫ I just stared at you smiling in front of me ♫

So embarrassing.

[Dare to Love Me]

01:00:07.467 --> 01:00:09.483
This is an accident. A major accident.

01:00:09.507 --> 01:00:12.643
My heart wasn't ill. It just went crazy.

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:16.913
I slept with a man? With Young Master's friend, even?

01:00:16.937 --> 01:00:20.033
Yoon Bok, don't you miss Mom? To be honest, she...

01:00:20.057 --> 01:00:22.783
Don't ever bring her up in front of me again.

01:00:22.807 --> 01:00:25.263
Seongsan Village is being accused of selling fake products.

01:00:25.287 --> 01:00:29.473
Their expensive, traditionally made products turned out to be imported from abroad?

01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:32.893
How does this make sense? This is so unfair and frustrating!

01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:34.493
What happened, exactly?

01:00:34.517 --> 01:00:37.173
I think someone intended to do this.

01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.673
Yoon Bok, thank you for everything.

01:00:39.697 --> 01:00:43.433
You have no idea how dependable you are to me.

01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:46.013
- What's this?
- Noona, haven't you seen my letter?

01:00:46.037 --> 01:00:48.783
What? What do I do?

01:00:48.807 --> 01:00:50.983
Hey, what did you write in that letter?
