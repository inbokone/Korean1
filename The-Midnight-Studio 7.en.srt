It's still 15 minutes before the sunset.

353
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,990
The days are long because it's summer.

354
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,750
- Deputy Go.
- Yes?

355
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,700
I have a question.

356
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,200
How could you wait three years for a blind date when you can't remember her name or face?

357
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,520
My last memory right before I died was going out to meet her.

358
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,110
But I don't know why I pictured your face.

359
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,710
- I think I know.
- What is it?

360
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,450
She must've been very beautiful like me.

361
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,750
There's no doubt about that. Right.

362
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:26,690
Mr. Seo, why can't you look at Ms. Han in her eyes?

363
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,950
Huh? You're right.

364
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,690
Did something happen to you two, by chance?

365
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,140
Why are you suddenly blushing?

366
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh? You're right.

367
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,290
What happening? I-It's because of the safe zone.

368
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,200
Maintaining a safe distance. Don't you know?

369
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Eat quickly and come inside.

370
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,600
Geez!

371
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,960
Don't be like that and have some. Here.

372
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,680
You always get beat up by the evil spirits because you're so weak.

373
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,590
When did I ever get beat up?

374
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,180
Whoa, whoa... Sit further away from each other.

375
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,850
I-I feel unsafe right now.

376
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,230
Maintaining a safe distance. Don't you know?

377
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,310
Oh, sorry.

378
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,300
There. Better, right?

379
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,630
Here's the next story.

380
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,620
Chief Prosecutor Lee Hyeon Oh of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office was nominated as the minister of justice.

381
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,810
This happened 58 days after Seok Mi Gyu, the former minister of justice, resigned.

382
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,880
Reporter Kim Jae Min is here to report.

383
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,400
President Han Seung Cheol stressed equality and justice

384
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,580
while nominating Lee Hyeon Oh.

385
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,520
With equal and just enforcement of law, I won't leave anyone behind...

386
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,580
- They're all the same.
- and make sure no one is treated unjustly...

387
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,940
A man who tried to save a woman attempting suicide on a bridge

388
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,290
lost his life due to an unfortunate accident.

389
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,010
The man was in his 20s and volunteered at a suicide prevention center.

390
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,050
ONA's reporter Yoon Ha Yeong will explain the situation.

391
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,710
This is footage of a bridge at the Han River late afternoon on the 10th.

392
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,830
A woman is standing on the edge of the railing.

393
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,530
A man hurried over to stop her.

394
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,320
She appears to be hesitating momentarily after talking to him.

395
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,180
She ends up pushing him into the river and runs away.

396
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,050
How could she do that to someone who tried to save her?

397
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,710
I know. It couldn't have been easy for him to go and try to save her.

398
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,350
Hold on.

399
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,000
Doesn't she look kind of strange?

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
It's that pattern I'm thinking of, right, Mr. Seo?

401
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,920
So Myeong was killed by an evil spirit the same way.

402
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,220
I think it's worth investigating.

403
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,750
- It's almost time now.
- To determine the cause of his death...

404
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,330
We should prepare to open.

405
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,570

Please don't cross the line.

409
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,540
Well, you might need the safe zone.

410
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,320
The studio itself is a safe zone.

411
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,450
That stupid line of his. I swear I'll cross that line someday.

412
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,570
Ever since I was a kid, I always had to cross the line my desk buddy created.

413
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,000
Mr. Seo, why are you so mean to her?

414
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,900
Be honest with me. You did something wrong, didn't you?

415
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,960
She's the one who did something wrong. She kissed me out of the blue-

416
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,430
K-Ki-what?

417
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,270
- Ki...
- Ki?

418
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,790
She suddenly kicked me.

419
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,270
Geez. Why would Ms. Han kick you?

420
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,830
She kissed him, more like.

421
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,000
Cut the nonsense and prepare to receive the customer.

422
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,440
You've never kissed, Mr. Seo?

423
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,520
I'm not happy with you today, okay?

Aigoo, have you been taking complaints all night?

529

Because of you, people think this is a neighborhood substation, not the criminal division.

This is the fifth one this month already.

532
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,810
Maybe the people who hated the cat caretaker killed them.

533
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,340
There were few cases like that.
