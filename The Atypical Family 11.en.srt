1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,951
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

2
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,627
{\an8}- Are you cold?
- Huh?

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,545
{\an8}No.

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,423
{\an8}Then why are you all wrapped up?

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,056
{\an8}Hey, nice pants.

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,019
{\an8}- Come here. Let me get a closer look.
- No.

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,814
- Let me see them.
- No, stop it.

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,357
I said stop.

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,778
You tease.

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,363
Fine, stay wrapped up.

11
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,990
- There.
- Thanks.

12
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,620
Let me see!

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,796
I feel warm now.

14
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,263
By the way,

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,642
how did you manage to go back to the past?

16
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,608
You mean how was I happy without you?

17
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:52,862
We're family.

18
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,157
No matter how far apart we are.

19
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,284
Someone once told me

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,955
that a family had to
have each other's backs.

21
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,332
Just like

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,918
you saved I-na and me,

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,002
I'm going to--

24
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,087
Don't save me.

25
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,339
Don't go back.

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,926
Promise me.

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,434
But if I don't,

28
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,230
the times we've spent together
might disappear.

29
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,775
It'll be as if you never saved us.

30
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,319
But I'm not going back yet.

31
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,538
I'll go after we've spent
a long, happy life together.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,748
After I-na is all grown up.

33
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,708
Actually,

34
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
I'll wait for I-na to have a baby

35
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,795
and then for her baby

36
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,464
to get married.

37
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,549
You're silly.

38
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,468
I won't put it off for too long.

39
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,679
I'll go when I'm 99 years old.

40
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,140
I can save you then, right?

41
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,443
No.

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,114
I'll never let you go.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,200
I won't let you go either.

44
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,827
I can't breathe.

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,378
Da-hae.

46
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,672
Yeah?

47
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,091
What was that?

48
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,904
Welcome.

49
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,328
Have a seat.

50
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,254
Did you come alone?

51
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,760
- Two soups to go, please.
- Sure.

52
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,807
So she really is alive.

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,146
But here's what I don't get.

54
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,899
I know Da-hae doesn't leave
any loose ends,

55
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:22,155
but she didn't have to fool you
just to run away from me.

56
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,240
She wasn't running from you.

57
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,201
She was running from me.

58
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,041
I'm destined to die saving her.

59
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,252
She decided to disappear to save me.

60
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,177
Do you care to elaborate?

61
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,388
The person who saved Da-hae
from the fire 13 years ago

62
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:48,931
was me.

63
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,310
It hasn't happened to me yet,

64
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,146
but it's bound to happen.

65
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,483
I will save her.

66
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,444
You're going to save her,
knowing you will die?

67
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,904
That's right.

68
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,114
I put my life on the line.

69
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,575
I'll protect Da-hae with my life.

70
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,204
So whoever comes after Da-hae

71
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,832
better be ready to do the same.

72
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,478
Hey.

73
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,939
I heard there was
an amazing fish soup place.

74
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,274
Look.

75
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,785
Welcome back.

76
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,581
Look over there. It's beautiful.

77
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,791
Yeah, I love this place.

78
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,007
Ta-da.

79
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,593
Thanks.

80
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,394
It's so good.

81
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,857
So pretty.

82
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,776
I meant the sandwich.

83
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,782
- It's good, right?
- It's really good.

84
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,922
Why do you keep glancing at me?

85
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,675
Don't worry about it.

86
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,389
I guess I do have a sexy neck.

87
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,809
I know.

88
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,020
I can't stop looking.

89
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,565
You can look at it all you want.

90
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,358
- Should we go to our room?
- What?

91
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,985
Stop it.

92
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
We should head home.

93
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,200
You wanna go home already?

94
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,869
But my trip just began.

95
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,288
Your family's waiting for you.

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,297
They knew about everything, didn't they?

97
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,219
Everyone but I-na.

98
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,348
But I'm sure she'll find out soon.

99
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,267
You can't hide anything from her.

100
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>Dad is going to die?</i>

101
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,556
Where's I-na?

102
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,350
I-na found out.

103
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,689
I can't believe I never looked at
my own granddaughter's eyes all this time.

104
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,817
I was so hung up on seeing the future

105
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,944
that I missed what was under my nose.

106
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,757
I messed everything up.

107
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,345
After Ms. Da-hae made
such a difficult decision to save you.

108
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,639
It was a stupid decision.

109
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,641
You didn't mess anything up.

110
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,351
So don't worry.

111
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,531
Look at me.

112
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,117
Please?

113
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,952
I-na.

114
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
I don't want to.

115
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,666
I can't.

116
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,472
Can we talk?

117
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,393
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,021
My scam wasn't perfect.

119
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,816
You've done more than enough.

120
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,779
I saw your determination to save Gwi-ju.

121
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,572
So thank you.

122
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm not done yet.

123
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,369
I'll find another way.

124
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,873
There's no way to change the future.

125
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,043
The person who saved me

126
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,920
had a red spot on the back of his neck,

127
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,505
but Gwi-ju doesn't.

128
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,842
If you could look for more clues
in your dreams…

129
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,053
My dreams were never precognitive.

130
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,306
Sorry?

131
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,141
They were a curse.

132
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
Think carefully.

133
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,942
Was it really your decision
to be with Do Da-hae?

134
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,659
Are you sure it wasn't
because of Mom's dreams?

135
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,411
"Do Da-hae is the one for you."

136
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,371
"You're destined to save her."

137
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,415
"That's the way it is."

138
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,335
You might have started believing that
without even realizing it.

139
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,712
Eventually,
it made you develop feelings for her,

140
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,674
and now you believe
it's your mission to save her.

141
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,633
Isn't that right?

142
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,470
No, it isn't.

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,223
Yes, it is.

144
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,767
You better get yourself together.

145
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
Gwi-ju.

146
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,609
Do you know why I ended up like this?

147
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,992
You probably didn't know
because you never cared about me,

148
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,996
but I used to be
an up-and-coming fashion model.

149
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,956
I became a lead model in no time,

150
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,417
and I was about to be
in the finale of a show.

151
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,919
It was the opportunity of a lifetime.

152
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,214
But Mom had a dream
the night before the show.

153
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,674
What did she see?

154
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,722
The lead model got badly hurt
and ruined the show.

155
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,849
So she told me not to go.

156
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,272
What the hell?

157
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,692
I can't reach Dong-hee.

158
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,777
I know it's on short notice,

159
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,530
but can you take her place?

160
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,085
Go.

161
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,590
<i>Those heels were custom-made for me.</i>

162
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,718
<i>For me only.</i>

163
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,642
Are you okay?

164
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,477
- Coming through.
- Are you all right?

165
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,480
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me.

166
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,273
- Can you stand up?
- Make way.

167
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,776
This looks bad.

168
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,693
No photos.

169
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,820
No photos, please.

170
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,155
<i>I was the one</i>

171
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,782
who ruined the show.

172
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,410
But isn't it strange?

173
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,081
None of that would've happened
if Mom didn't dream about it.

174
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,043
I guess not.

175
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,921
I let Mom's dream jerk me around.

176
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,175
Mom never liked me being in the spotlight.

177
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,719
She didn't want to be found out.

178
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,597
What if I ignored her dream

179
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,891
and went to the show anyway?

180
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,436
What if I created a future for myself?

181
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,732
These questions kept haunting me.

182
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:24,405
I couldn't keep it together
without shoving food into my mouth.

183
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,117
And so I ate

184
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,910
and ate.

185
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,458
Don't let Mom's dreams stop you.

186
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,044
You can change the future.

187
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,547
I couldn't,

188
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,507
but you should.

189
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,054
Dong-hee is going to be unhappy.

190
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,474
Why?

191
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,978
I saw her and another woman in my dream.

192
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,647
Both of their hair was messed up
as if they had a fight.

193
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,566
At her new home, no less.

194
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
Jo Ji-han.

195
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,862
That bastard must be cheating on her.

196
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,865
Dong-hee was crying her heart out.

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,454
Why don't you tell her about your dream
and talk her out of marrying--

198
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,496
I can't do that.

199
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,540
I've already ruined her dream once.

200
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,293
I can't get in the way
of her long-awaited marriage.

201
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
I don't want to dream anymore.

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,132
My dreams didn't show me the future.

203
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,219
They only cursed my children to hell.

204
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,641
<i>I'm the curse.</i>

205
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,603
Mom died on my birthday.

206
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,231
And Dad is going to die
on the day I was born.

207
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,486
- I-na.
- I should never have looked.

208
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,613
I never want to look

209
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,741
anyone in the eye again.

210
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,208
I guess there really is a curse
in this family.

211
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,337
You're all born with something

212
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,965
that others can only dream of,

213
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,801
but you take it for granted.

214
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>You're worried people will find out.</i>

215
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,263
<i>You want it all to yourself.</i>

216
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,975
So you get scared.

217
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,602
You let it make you miserable

218
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,980
instead of using it properly.

219
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,608
I'll be the one

220
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,027
to lift that curse.

221
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,456
Your grandma might have seen the future,

222
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,501
but I'll change it.

223
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,716
I'll lift the curse.

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,219
And as for your dad,

225
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,887
Bok Gwi-ju,

226
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,724
I'll save him.

227
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,060
This is it.

228
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,944
This place was put together
by this up-and-coming designer.

229
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,531
But that's not the best part.

230
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,324
Ta-da.

231
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,618
What do you think?

232
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,995
Amazing view, right?

233
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,663
Yeah.

234
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,458
- It's nice.
- Right?

235
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,044
I knew you'd like it.

236
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,755
You love the view from up high.

237
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,967
I did so much legwork
to find this apartment.

238
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,803
Well? Should I sign the contract?

239
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,515
Ji-han.

240
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah?

241
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,727
How would you feel

242
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,522
about moving in with my family?

243
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,986
You want me to live with your family?

244
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,780
What, are you scared of them?

245
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,948
No.

246
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,658
I…

247
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,453
wouldn't mind it at all,

248
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,415
but you said you were
sick and tired of them.

249
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
You couldn't wait to move out.

250
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,128
That's why I found this nice apartment.

251
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,839
To get you out of there.

252
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,551
Did I say that?

253
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,472
Never mind then.

254
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,518
Dong-hee.

255
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,270
You scared me to death there.

256
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,605
Look.

257
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,273
Do you see the sweat on my back?

258
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,986
I'll send you the account number.

259
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,321
Wire the security deposit.

260
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,574
The deposit is a bit high,

261
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,120
but I managed to get
a discount on the rent.

262
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,292
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

263
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,673
Here you go.

264
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,676
It's your favorite drink, babe.

265
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
I missed you like crazy.

266
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,140
Liar.

267
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,641
I'm serious.

268
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,393
You want me to prove it?

269
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,310
Prove it.

270
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,242
See you.

271
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,217
MESSAGES

272
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,264
What the hell?

273
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,601
Who's sending these?

274
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,335
- Who are you?
- If you want to be one of the Boks,

275
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,878
you better be prepared.

276
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,130
They have a secret.

277
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,217
Have you noticed anything yet?

278
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,635
What?

279
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,972
They have

280
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,183
superpowers.

281
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,809
What?

282
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,479
Your mother-in-law sees the future.

283
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,897
Your brother-in-law sees the past.

284
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,524
Your niece reads people's minds.

285
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,986
And your fiancée,
to whom you'll be wed for life,

286
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,155
watches from above.

287
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,075
You may as well have a drone
hovering over you.

288
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,035
- What are you talking about?
- Basically,

289
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,288
whatever funny business you're up to,

290
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,875
they'll be watching
every single move you make,

291
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,877
no matter where or when.

292
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,171
Call off your wedding.

293
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,591
It's in your best interest.

294
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,928
This isn't funny.

295
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,138
Just tell me how much you want.

296
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,890
How much?

297
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,520
So you won't back down?

298
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm about to be loaded.

299
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,315
You want me to throw that away?

300
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,902
I'll think of this as an investment.

301
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,405
Is 20 million won good enough?

302
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,743
Add another zero.

303
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
200 million?

304
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,499
Bring me the money before the wedding,

305
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,001
or those pictures I sent you

306
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,421
will be blasted on the big screen
during the ceremony.

307
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,258
Okay?

308
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,635
Who the hell do you think you are?

309
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,470
- You don't scare me.
- Let go!

310
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,765
Give me the phone! Let go!

311
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,065
Are you scared now?

312
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,153
The thing is,

313
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,238
I really don't have any money.

314
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,365
Okay?

315
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:10,037
You must've gotten the wrong idea
because I exude elegance,

316
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,122
but I'm actually broke.

317
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,167
Also, the wedding's
just around the corner.

318
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,711
How am I supposed to
get that kind of money?

319
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,838
Sir?

320
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,388
So call off the wedding.

321
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,518
Simple, right?

322
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,696
Here.

323
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,097
Will you be okay?

324
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,558
Mom must have found out
that you betrayed her for me.

325
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,939
Why do you think I'm here?

326
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,488
My goodness,
Mom must not be ready to let me go.

327
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,534
Why? Does she love me that much?

328
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,286
This is no time to be meddling
in other people's business.

329
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,000
You should stop meddling
in my business too

330
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,503
and do as Mom says from now on.

331
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,091
I mean,

332
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,553
I was supposed to die 13 years ago.

333
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,346
I've lived long enough.

334
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,516
Just stay out of my way.

335
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,601
I mean it.

336
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,358
Do you have to go this far to save Gwi-ju?

337
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,073
Tell Mom

338
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,701
that I'm looking forward to it.

339
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,210
She said she was supposed to die
13 years ago anyway

340
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,796
and told me to stay out of her way.

341
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,218
They're both so eager
to risk their lives for each other.

342
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,097
It's just so heart-wrenching.

343
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,685
Bring me Grace.

344
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,769
Dong-hee, you up?

345
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,826
Don't come in!

346
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,413
I said don't come in!

347
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,874
Why are you hiding
like you're doing something wrong?

348
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,251
Because I am.

349
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,295
I'm too heavy to fly,

350
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,131
and I'm stuffing my face again.

351
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,929
Maybe I'll never be

352
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,182
the way I was before.

353
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,900
You weren't that skinny to begin with.

354
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,904
Hey, don't you remember
how I looked in my twenties?

355
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,114
I meant way before that.

356
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,616
In elementary school.

357
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,578
Let's not go there, okay?

358
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,663
If you ask me,

359
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,873
you looked the prettiest back then.

360
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,210
What? You little…

361
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,670
Shut up.

362
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,963
Do you remember

363
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,340
when I was in the hospital?

364
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,175
Of course.

365
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,053
When that puppy got hit by a motorcycle.

366
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,933
You wandered in the past
for days without eating.

367
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,019
You ended up with malnutrition and…

368
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,688
Where did he go?

369
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,483
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

370
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,612
Eat your food.

371
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,031
No.

372
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
You're sick because you didn't eat.

373
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
I don't want to.

374
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,167
Mom's gonna yell at you for not eating.

375
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,003
Can you eat it for me?

376
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,673
If I do, I'll be in trouble <i>for</i> eating.

377
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,719
Come on, before Mom comes.

378
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,180
Darn it.

379
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,726
I guess I'll have to eat.

380
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,174
Is it good?

381
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,134
Yes, it's really good.

382
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,389
Can I

383
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,224
try some?

384
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,935
I'll feed you.

385
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,774
Here.

386
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,320
It's good, right?

387
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,447
Yes.

388
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,535
Seeing you eat makes me happy.

389
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,746
- It makes me want to eat too.
- Really?

390
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,250
They should have you eat on TV.

391
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,169
It'd work up the viewers' appetites
and cheer them up.

392
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,964
No way. Who would watch that?

393
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,549
The show should be called…

394
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,467
What about "<i>mukbang</i>"?

395
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,802
As in "the eating show."

396
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,431
Come on. No one's going to watch that.

397
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,350
Here. Have some more.

398
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,814
- It's so good.
- What was that?

399
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,317
You made me spit out my food.

400
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,113
I was right.

401
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,409
You really were the prettiest

402
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,536
in elementary school.

403
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,581
Don't you have a better memory to revisit?

404
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,417
You're wasting your power.

405
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,711
You were more yourself back then.

406
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,422
You flew much better then.

407
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,759
You flew all over the place like a bee.

408
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,511
Did I?

409
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,641
Your weight might not be the problem.

410
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,187
You know what I think it is?

411
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,023
You were happy back then.

412
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,484
Being with you

413
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,986
made me happy too.

414
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,573
I don't know…

415
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,327
why I'm so unhappy now.

416
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,749
I'm much skinnier than I was
in elementary school.

417
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,920
And I'm finally getting married

418
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,839
to the person I loved so much.

419
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,552
So why am I so unhappy?

420
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,934
I think you already know.

421
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,020
You said "loved,"

422
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,689
not "love."

423
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,217
You actually got the cash.

424
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,761
Where'd you get it?

425
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,180
That's none of your business.

426
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,141
It's the exact amount you wanted.

427
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,894
So keep your word.

428
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,742
- Jeez!
- Da-hae.

429
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,873
You're still alive.

430
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,708
So good to see you.

431
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,503
Did Mom send you?

432
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,597
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

433
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,393
You're getting married tomorrow.

434
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,353
And?

435
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,938
Does that make you sad?

436
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,523
No.

437
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,609
If anything,

438
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,737
it makes me want you even more.

439
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,574
You're so cute.

440
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,999
You sent a wedding present?

441
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,127
I hope it doesn't arrive too early.

442
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,757
Why do I have to see it
in the middle of the night?

443
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,302
It's fresh, so it can go bad in no time.

444
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,639
Plus, you can give me
a tour of your place.

445
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,234
You naughty girl.

446
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,324
Let me get a taste of you
before you're someone else's man.

447
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,749
You're extra naughty tonight, aren't you?

448
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,919
Is this why you wanted us to meet here?

449
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,838
What are you talking about?
You told me to meet you here.

450
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,633
- Did I?
- Yes.

451
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,681
- What's going on?
- Hold on.

452
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,059
- Come here.
- This is bad.

453
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,728
- Hurry up.
- What do we do?

454
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,861
What are you doing here?

455
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,863
Hi, Dong-hee.

456
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,823
Hey, you.

457
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,870
Hey.

458
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,956
Long time no see, Grace.

459
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,135
I wanted to surprise you.

460
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,053
You came right on time.

461
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,972
We're so in sync.

462
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,853
My present should be here somewhere.

463
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,397
What present?

464
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,692
I knew it.

465
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,903
The rotten stench is
already stinking up the place.

466
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,754
Hey, don't…

467
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,599
Ji-han promised me a salad café.

468
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,059
I never said that.

469
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,310
You're the worst.

470
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,021
Wait.

471
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,327
Please forgive me.

473
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,286
We should

474
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,747
cancel the lease contract.

475
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,458
Yes, of course.

476
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,212
I'll live with your family if you want.

477
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,923
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

478
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,094
We're not calling off our wedding
over something like this, are we?

479
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,764
Think about the cancellation fees
for our wedding and honeymoon.

480
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,225
That's my money anyway.

481
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,521
You're not the only one who spent money.

482
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,565
Do you know how much it cost me
to save our wedding?

483
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,987
I had to jump through hoops
to get that money.

484
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,323
So you're marrying me

485
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,742
solely for my money?

486
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,122
- Of course not.
- I already knew.

487
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,500
Even I could see that money was
the only desirable thing about me.

488
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,336
But I thought, no matter the reason,

489
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,421
as long as you loved me,

490
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,924
I could love myself too.

491
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,639
I love you, okay?

492
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,601
I love you, Dong-hee.

493
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,478
I love you so much.

494
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,771
It's too late.

495
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,232
There's someone else

496
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,818
who tells me I'm pretty now.

497
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,987
Are you seeing another guy?

498
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,823
What do you care?

499
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,741
It's over between us,

500
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,410
except that you still owe me.

501
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,538
Pay me back the money
I lent you for your clinic.

502
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,956
Hey.

503
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,624
Bok Dong-hee!

504
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,084
He already paid you back.

505
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,261
Do Da-hae?

506
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,100
We collected the money for you, Dong-hee.

507
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
- You know her?
- Poor Bok Don't Eat.

508
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,901
She's way too soft to get her money back.

509
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,115
Hold on a second.

510
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,950
Are you saying

511
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,953
you were all in on this?

512
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,413
Okay.

513
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,248
Give me my money.

514
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,129
Damn it.

515
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,757
- Wow.
- Give me that.

516
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,592
Hey.

517
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,137
Give me that.

518
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,431
- Give it to me.
- Take it.

519
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,059
Think fast!

520
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,812
Dong-hee, Grace is a really bad person.

521
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,106
- Do you know what she did?
- I do.

522
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,525
- She tried to hook up with you.
- Exactly!

523
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,195
You knew?

524
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,697
Her size may be extra-small now,

525
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,242
but she still has a big heart.

526
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,245
Why would you want anyone but her?

527
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,663
Shut up.

528
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,500
Give me that.

529
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,171
Ow, my back.

530
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,589
Hey.

531
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,049
Give me that.

532
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,053
Give me that!

533
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,889
- Hey.
- Take it.

534
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,350
No!

535
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,311
Let go!

536
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,146
Let go!

537
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,901
- Damn it.
- Give me that.

538
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,070
You little…

539
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,424
What are you eating now?
You'll lose your power at this rate!

540
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,261
Someone could see you.

541
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,471
Stop flying all the time.

542
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,974
<i>You can't fly. Don't fly.</i>

543
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,309
<i>Don't let anyone see you.</i>

544
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,850
Are we flying?

545
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,227
You said it was your dream.

546
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,438
Bok Don't Eat.

547
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,524
You're flying.

548
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,198
- You did it!
- Wait, the bag!

549
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,240
Don't drop the money!

550
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,701
I got it.

551
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,998
All right. Hold on tight.

552
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,051
No, this isn't my fault.

553
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,178
Yes, it was an accident.

554
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,895
I feel amazing!

555
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,315
What the hell?

556
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,653
Bok Don't Eat!

557
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,623
<i>I saw her and another woman in my dream.</i>

558
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,835
Both of their hair was messed up
as if they had a fight.

559
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,962
<i>At her new home, no less.</i>

560
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,589
<i>They were crying tears of joy,
not of heartbreak.</i>

561
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,550
There was more to it…

562
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,137
than Ms. Bok saw in her dream.

563
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:33,973
I…

564
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,891
I flew.

565
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,062
I flew.

566
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,398
Dodari!

567
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,360
Dodari!

568
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,331
<i>It wasn't a curse.</i>

569
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,668
Your dreams
really are precognitive, Ms. Bok.

570
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,337
I was able to come up with a plan

571
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,214
because you dreamed about Dong-hee.

572
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,467
It helped her avert a misfortune.

573
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,608
I was driving myself
straight into a load of crap,

574
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,527
but I barely got away.

575
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,909
So it's really about
how we interpret the dreams.

576
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,868
Yes.

577
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,828
But you already knew that, Father.

578
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,122
You never sat around
waiting for the future.

579
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,918
You did whatever was necessary
to make dreams come true.

580
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,506
You can't change your dreams,

581
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,217
but you can choose how to interpret them.

582
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,303
Your dream may not have
shown you everything.

583
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,305
Perhaps you were too afraid

584
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,015
to see everything clearly.

585
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,977
So please keep on dreaming.

586
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,688
Gwi-ju can…

587
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,525
still be saved.

588
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,905
Your dream

589
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,534
brought us our savior.

590
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,871
But one thing upsets me.

591
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,292
Dong-hee is just Dong-hee,
my husband is Father,

592
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,503
but I'm still Ms. Bok?

593
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,674
Wow, Mom.

594
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm sorry,

595
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,303
Mother.

596
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,896
I-na.

597
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,155
Will you…

598
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,449
go somewhere with me?

599
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,424
ZOO CLOSES IN 30 MINUTES

600
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,263
What are we doing here?

601
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,310
I wanted to keep the promise

602
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,562
I made on your birthday way back.

603
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,024
I wanted to take you to the zoo
and buy you cotton candy.

604
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,235
I guess that's not happening.

605
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,617
Let's come back another time.

606
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,661
I'll do my research
before next time, okay?

607
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,413
What if there's no next time?

608
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,220
- Two tickets, please.
- We're closing soon.

609
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,680
That's fine. I'll take them.

610
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,099
Here you go.

611
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,559
Thank you.

612
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,272
Let's go, I-na.

613
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,942
Welcome.

614
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,364
Wait here.

615
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,576
- Can we get some cotton candy?
- We just closed.

616
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,996
My daughter loves cotton candy.
Is there anything you can do?

617
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,373
Just a minute.

618
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:10,916
That'll be 4,000 won.

619
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,251
Here you go. Thank you.

620
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,502
Thank you.

621
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,036
This may look like the end,

622
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,330
but there's always a tomorrow.

623
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,126
The moment you were born can't be the end.

624
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,379
It's actually where it all begins.

625
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,091
I'll save Da-hae,

626
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,178
Da-hae will save our family,

627
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,473
and you'll make my dream come true.

628
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,642
My happy moment will

629
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,770
bring everyone happiness.

630
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,710
I'm sure reading people's minds

631
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,213
can be sad and painful.

632
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,424
Seeing what other people can't

633
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,219
is bound to be

634
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,721
lonely and scary.

635
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,267
I used to think my power was a curse too.

636
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,063
I wished I couldn't see the past at all.

637
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,023
And eventually…

638
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,321
I couldn't even see
what everyone else could.

639
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,160
You were right in front of me,

640
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,955
but I couldn't see you…

641
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,124
even though I wanted to.

642
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,003
So don't run away.

643
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,422
I won't either.

644
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,093
The moment you were born…

645
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,722
is the best present I've ever gotten.

646
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,018
And I'm going to embrace it.

647
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,603
I won't run.

648
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,730
I'll cherish it.

649
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,940
Dad…

650
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,241
Let's come earlier next time.

651
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,952
And let's…

652
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,997
bring Ms. Da-hae.

653
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,750
- Okay.
- And…

654
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,919
let's get churros.

655
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,632
I love churros.

656
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,678
You got it.

657
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,474
You have a guest.

658
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,103
Tell them they'll have to wait.

659
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,193
- I'll see you outside.
- Okay.

660
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,877
Didn't Uncle tell you I was here?

661
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,462
You came too?

662
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,049
Is someone else here?

663
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,135
I have another guest.
You're gonna have to wait.

664
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,224
Who's your guest?

665
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,021
Talk to me.

666
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,532
Sorry to keep you waiting.

667
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,038
Why did you come alone?

668
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,331
It's okay.

669
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,376
She must've wanted to
discuss something in private.

670
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,295
Why did you want to see me?

671
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,882
I try my best to keep my word.

672
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,108
I told you I'd contribute
a generous amount when they got married.

673
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,735
Mom.

674
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,121
{\an8}It's just so heart-wrenching.

675
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,205
{\an8}2 DAYS BEFORE THE OPERATION

676
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,667
Bring me Grace.

677
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,297
Did you want to see me?

678
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,550
Did Da-hae learn nothing from me?

679
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,178
She's gonna need some help.

680
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:01,308
Jo Ji-han, or whatever his name is,
is after what I couldn't get.

681
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,225
I don't like it.

682
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,520
Let's show him we're the ones
who run scams around here.

683
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,648
You want to help her?

684
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,319
{\an8}1 DAY BEFORE THE OPERATION

685
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,451
Damn it.

686
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,626
I need a loan.
One with a low interest rate.

687
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,718
What the hell?

688
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,767
Looking for low-interest loans?

689
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,685
Pardon?

690
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,316
Yes, please.

691
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,153
All right.

692
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,197
Here you go.

693
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,533
Your thumbprint, please.

694
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,327
You guys are legit, right?

695
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,287
Don't even worry about it.

696
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,748
Let's seal the deal with your thumbprint.

697
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,132
There you go.

698
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,677
Nicely done.

699
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,886
Thank you.

700
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,846
{\an8}Did Mom send you?

701
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:25,183
{\an8}Uncle told me you were
cooking something up.

702
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,519
I want in.

703
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,148
I'm worried about Bok Don't Eat.

704
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,359
I can't watch a jerk like Jo Ji-han

705
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,820
ruin her life.

706
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,824
Also, he was supposed to be my target.

707
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,034
I've got dibs on him.

708
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,264
Why did you do it?

709
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,183
It's not like you.

710
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:12,272
You said you'd make my life miserable
in the cruelest way possible.

711
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,066
Turns out,

712
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,902
losing you was…

713
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,531
the most cruel punishment
anyone could put me through.

714
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,375
My baby.

715
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,130
I'm so relieved that you're alive.

716
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,132
<i>In my dream,</i>

717
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:43,053
you were crying,
holding your grown-up daughter.

718
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,766
<i>You said you were relieved
that she was alive.</i>

719
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,017
Mom.

720
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,783
Thank you

721
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,578
for being the daughter
that I didn't deserve.

722
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,041
I'm sorry

723
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,544
that I could never be your real family.

724
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,759
And I'm glad you found a real one.

725
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,014
You're being weird.

726
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,350
What's gotten into you?

727
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,728
What did I tell you?

728
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,066
I just wanted to see

729
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,404
you and Gwi-ju happy together.

730
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,950
Did you not believe me
because I was a swindler?

731
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,913
Mom.

732
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,877
Be happy.

733
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,966
That'll bring you money.

734
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,305
I hope you lay a lot of golden eggs.

735
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,394
My gosh.

736
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,361
That's more like you.

737
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,750
Thanks for everything.

738
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,933
What's that smell?

739
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,062
I know this smell.

740
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,396
I knew you'd remember.

741
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,483
Dad used to make it all the time
when we were kids.

742
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,567
- Braised pollock.
- Braised pollock!

743
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,664
It tastes exactly like Dad's.

744
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,874
- Right?
- Yeah.

745
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,420
Why don't you make it anymore?

746
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,005
Well…

747
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,091
The thing is…

748
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,764
Did Grandma ban it?

749
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,477
Every time he made it,

750
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,313
I always ended up eating way too much.

751
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:43,817
But wait.

752
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,237
How did you make this, Gwi-ju?

753
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,197
I know.

754
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,367
I'd completely forgotten the recipe.

755
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,620
I went back in time
and watched you make it.

756
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,250
Share the recipe with him.

757
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,961
He could learn from his past self.

758
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,838
I really could.

759
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,300
This takes me back too.

760
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,304
This is what the house smelled like
when we came back from the playground.

761
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,224
Now, watch this.

762
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,226
Get a spoonful of rice…

763
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,313
and top it with some radish.

764
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,363
Perfect.

765
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,075
- Let's eat.
- Let's try it.

766
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,743
Thank you for the food.

767
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,288
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you for cooking.

768
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,413
Do you need help?

769
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,917
I'm struggling with this part.

770
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,257
Like that.

771
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,846
Like that?

772
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,349
- Did I do it?
- No.

773
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,235
Why are you suddenly practicing so hard?

774
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,242
I want to show someone…

775
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,162
that I have a passion.

776
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,083
And that I've been working hard on it,

777
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,378
although I'm not great at it.

778
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,712
And…

779
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,716
I want to show them

780
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,970
that I have all these great friends.

781
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,805
That I'm not…

782
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,100
invisible anymore.

783
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,650
Okay, let's try that again.

784
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,443
Okay.

785
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,952
It's not a guy, is it?

786
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

787
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,919
Did you just wink at someone?

788
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,508
You look even better in the future.

789
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,387
How come you look better and better?

790
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,473
Stop it.

791
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,817
It's so good.

792
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,486
- I think the meat's cooked.
- Okay.

793
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,779
Here you go.

794
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,910
Honey.

795
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,955
I'm right here.

796
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,124
I saw the fire again.

797
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,960
The flames were everywhere.

798
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,507
There must be a reason
you keep seeing it in your dreams.

799
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,760
You have to get a good look.

800
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,305
I'll be by your side.

801
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,643
You'll find me
as soon as you open your eyes.

802
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,353
Don't be scared.

803
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,029
Here.

804
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,913
Should I put on some music?

805
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,460
Come in.

806
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,104
You're glancing at me again.

807
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,480
I know.

808
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,942
I just can't keep my eyes off you.

809
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,403
What do you like so much about me?

810
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,949
Show me where.

811
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,622
Here.

812
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,667
Where else?

813
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,335
Where else?

814
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,255
There has to be more.

815
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,340
Your armpits.

816
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,357
What's that?

817
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,329
This song is…

818
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,457
Do you remember it?

819
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,418
I had forgotten all about it.

820
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,171
I tried to imitate Gwi-ju's superpower.

821
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,424
It's been a while.

822
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,551
Shall we dance?

823
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,472
As if you haven't been
shimmying with another woman.

824
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,017
I'm sorry.

825
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,060
I'd like to undo

826
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,021
what I've done.

827
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,026
Shall we turn the clock back?

828
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,753
You're stepping on me.

829
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,713
Just follow my lead.

830
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,397
Hey, Dodari.
Don't you know how to ride a bike?

831
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,691
I guess no one taught her.

832
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,110
I know. Look at her.

833
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,571
You can't do it, can you?

834
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,532
Yes, I can. I'm good at it.

835
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,575
As if.

836
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:17,914
<i>- Dodari can't even</i>
- Hey, my name isn't Dodari!

837
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:22,043
<i>- Ride a bike
</i>- It's Do Da-hae!

838
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:26,464
<i>- Dodari can't even
- Dodari can't even</i>

839
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:30,885
<i>- Ride a bike
- Ride a bike</i>

840
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,113
I did it.

841
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,741
I did it!

842
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,357
You snooze, you lose.

843
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,068
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

844
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,279
What the heck?

845
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,240
How come she can ride now?

846
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,548
Gwi-ju.

847
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,341
Gwi-ju.

848
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,386
- Come downstairs. Let's eat.
- Okay.

849
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:04,979
What's this?

850
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,460
Gwi-ju.

851
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:29,587
Coming.

852
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,319
- Here you go.
- You don't have to eat this part.

853
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,445
Not too much.

854
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,155
That's enough.

855
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,046
Come here.

856
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,048
THE ATYPICAL FAMILY

857
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,954
{\an8}This is my chance to change the future.

858
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,956
{\an8}Gwi-ju.

859
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,292
{\an8}<i>Why are you in such a hurry?</i>

860
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,502
{\an8}<i>We'll get to decide</i>

861
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,254
{\an8}when we say goodbye.

862
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:36,755
{\an8}Nothing's changed.

863
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,924
{\an8}I said let go!

864
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,051
{\an8}I have another surprise.

865
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,845
{\an8}<i>Even though you can't change the future,</i>

866
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,931
{\an8}<i>you can decide how to respond to it.</i>

867
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:47,766
{\an8}<i>Da-hae.</i>

868
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,561
{\an8}<i>I'll be right back.</i>

869
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:57,109
