00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.924
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.114
- Hey. - Gosh. Give me that.

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:01.455
(Episode 11)

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:06.684
You should've called me before you came.

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:09.055
If I did, you would've told me you didn't have time for me.

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:12.525
I rarely eat at home.

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:13.595
You didn't have to bring any food.

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:19.635
You did a nice job making the house look cosy.

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.035
Gosh. What's this?

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.845
I see.

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:32.914
Gosh.

00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:48.164
- What? You have a closet in here? - Wait.

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:51.004
- Hold on. Mom. - I see.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.504
Mom. Stop. What was I going to say?

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:53.875
That.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:56.004
- What do I do with that? - What?

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:59.144
Do I just put the food in the fridge? What do I do?

00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.315
You don't like fresh kimchi.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.384
Keep the young radish kimchi outside for two days and then eat it.

00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:06.485
Okay.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:07.584
I marinated the meat for you...

00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:09.354
and packed diced vegetables into small portions.

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:10.724
So keep them in the freezer.

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:14.894
I'll take care of them later.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.634
Gosh. Give me that.

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:29.004
You should've told me to come by to pick them up.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.974
Why did you come all the way here? It's a hassle for you.

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:32.044
This is quite rewarding.

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:36.474
- I'll do it. - I got it. Gosh.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:38.645
When I bring a bagful of food to your brother,

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.854
he never thanks me for my hard work. Not even a word.

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:42.615
I coddled him too much...

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:44.655
for being the eldest child. So he's so spoiled now.

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.824
- Mom, here. - Okay.

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:53.365
Wait. Let me do it.

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:54.365
Okay.

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:10.645
Hang in there a little longer. I'm really sorry.

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:12.815
Hang in there.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:15.754
Gosh.

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:20.824
Goodness. How come you only have beer and water in the fridge?

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.095
- Mom, here. - Leave it there. Get me that.

00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:24.995
My goodness.

00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:30.764
So did you have breakfast?

00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:32.204
This is so upsetting.

00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:36.275
Other people think about what to have for lunch now.

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:37.504
Do you like waking up this late?

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:42.745
- Let's go out. I'll buy you lunch. - Goodness. Wait.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:44.845
Gosh, Mom. Let's go out.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:48.215
It hasn't been ten minutes since I got here.

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.484
I just can't wait to buy you a delicious lunch.

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:52.724
- Let's go. - Stop it. Where's the bathroom?

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:54.095
Why?

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:56.824
Why are you acting odd?

00:03:57.465 --> 00:03:58.724
Why would one want to go to the bathroom?

00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:01.465
Right.

00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:03.835
It's over there.

00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:08.134
There.

00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:16.444
Be careful. Let me turn on the light.

00:04:19.484 --> 00:04:21.484
Mom. Take your time. There's no rush.

00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:40.005
- It's okay. I'll just go. - Wait.

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:54.174
Look at that. Gosh.

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:10.554
Why were you guarding the door?

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:13.864
I have a big house here. I didn't want you to get lost.

00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:15.135
Is that supposed to be a joke?

00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:23.174
I don't have anything to drink in the house.

00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:24.474
Should I go and buy you some juice?

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:26.174
I don't need that. Take a seat.

00:06:26.174 --> 00:06:27.575
I came because I needed to talk to you. Sit down.

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:39.825
Your dad and I did some studying...

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:42.054
about top instructors, something we never thought...

00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:43.294
we would need to do.

00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:45.364
Just wait a little.

00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:47.794
I'll make everyone in Korea know my name.

00:06:48.064 --> 00:06:49.835
- When is that going to happen? - Pretty soon.

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:52.064
You know what? I want you to meet someone.

00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:55.434
You've heard of Plan A Study, right?

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.744
Yes. It's the biggest platform for online lectures in Korea.

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:01.374
When your dad worked at a stock firm,

00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:02.744
he had a junior colleague. And his son...

00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:04.414
Which means he's a stranger to me.

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:06.945
His son...

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:10.155
works in a team that recruits instructors for the lectures.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.124
So your dad mentioned you.

00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:14.424
He told your dad to send him...

00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:17.155
your resume and a video of your lecture if you had any.

00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.164
Wait. If you want to be a top instructor in this field,

00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:22.494
you must help students prepare...

00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:24.035
for the university entrance exam at a big company.

00:07:24.234 --> 00:07:25.905
What's the name of the lecture high school seniors...

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:27.705
and the entrance exam repeaters take?

00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:29.535
Yes, you should hold online lectures too.

00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:32.174
Go on.

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:34.674
Well, as for big companies like that,

00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:37.614
referrals and introductions play a big role.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:39.515
Apparently, you get jobs at places like that through connections.

00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:42.684
So Dad will be my connection to those jobs?

00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:45.224
He must have looked into it for you.

00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:48.455
No, thank you.

00:07:49.955 --> 00:07:51.965
I have a good reputation going at my current academy.

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:53.364
The last day to sign up to my lecture...

00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:54.395
during the school break is nearing too.

00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:55.564
But it's a small academy.

00:07:55.994 --> 00:07:57.535
I heard that top-rated instructors...

00:07:57.535 --> 00:07:59.364
have dozens or hundreds of students in their class.

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:00.905
It'll take forever to become...

00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:02.575
famous and successful when you work at a small academy.

00:08:02.575 --> 00:08:05.075
Listen. Many of these famous top-rated instructors...

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.814
started their careers by teaching 5 to 6 students at an academy.

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:10.314
I'll gain popularity here and join a bigger academy.

00:08:10.314 --> 00:08:11.885
Gosh. Don't talk back to me.

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:14.354
I got his email address. Send him your resume and the video.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:17.155
Hold on. Where's my phone? Yes, there.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.664
(Ms. Seo)

00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:30.294
My mom will leave soon.

00:08:30.564 --> 00:08:31.664
Wait a little longer.

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:43.244
I thought I had given birth...

00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:45.715
to a boy who was too handsome for his own good.

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:47.984
But good looks helped, I guess. You know?

00:08:48.914 --> 00:08:51.025
Hey, he said you could do well.

00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:54.255
Gosh. Can you look for the email address?

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:02.294
This means that your dad is coming around. You know?

00:09:05.704 --> 00:09:06.804
Gosh.

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:08.905
You know he's a proud man.

00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:11.375
He couldn't say that he would let you have your way.

00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:13.544
So instead, he found a good lead for your career.

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:18.414
Your dad is getting old too.

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:25.155
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you touched?

00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:28.794
I'm thinking.

00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:31.765
Gosh. What's there to think about?

00:09:33.164 --> 00:09:34.664
Tell him not to set up any meetings.

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:36.594
I won't prepare for it.

00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:39.235
Fine. You have pride, don't you?

00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:41.405
I knew you would feel awkward about this.

00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:42.934
It's not about that.

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:46.105
Turning it down isn't polite either.

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.914
Your dad asked for a favour. You'll make him look like a fool.

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:50.115
What if I were to go to the meeting?

00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:53.015
How would that make Dad look? You know?

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:56.515
I'll be 30 soon.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.125
If I were to go to a job interview, set up by my dad,

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:01.755
would that help him save face?

00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:07.064
Gosh. Why are you talking like that? You're scaring me.

00:10:07.594 --> 00:10:08.995
That wasn't your dad's intention.

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:11.265
I can make them want to impress me by sending me a car and a driver,

00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:13.605
so they have a shot at recruiting me.

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.245
You told me that you were at the peak price right now.

00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:19.875
Today is the youngest you'll ever be...

00:10:39.164 --> 00:10:40.194
Mom.

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:41.895
What?

00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:45.204
How much money should I put in my monthly savings account?

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:49.834
I'm not sure. How much do you earn every month?

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.804
When should I get married then?

00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:55.975
When I get married, where should I live?

00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:59.184
- Jun Ho. - How many children should I have?

00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:01.785
Do you want my child to be a daughter or a son?

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:04.424
Right. I'm thinking about buying a car.

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:06.054
Should I buy a new one or a used one?

00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:07.554
Which insurance company should I pick?

00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:09.794
Jun Ho.

00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:14.564
Is this my fault?

00:11:16.294 --> 00:11:17.804
Or are you and Dad going about this all wrong?

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:24.804
For now, I'll say it's my fault.

00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:26.544
Maybe, I wasn't a trustworthy son to you.

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.245
Gosh. That's not it.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:30.145
If you and Dad plan anything...

00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:32.084
about my life again,

00:11:34.684 --> 00:11:36.385
I might say harsher things to you then.

00:11:37.054 --> 00:11:38.655
When you have your own children...

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.954
I doubt I would be able to do what you and Dad did.

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:44.294
I wouldn't plan my child's life down to every minute and second.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:50.135
So my point is, you two should stop. You don't have to plan my life now.

00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:54.934
I don't understand what's gotten into you these days.

00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:57.375
- You're upsetting me. - What...

00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:02.314
Seriously? I'm perfectly healthy and have a job.

00:12:02.914 --> 00:12:04.645
I neither beat up nor con people.

00:12:06.245 --> 00:12:07.714
Why are you upset?

00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:13.785
You're upset because I can't satisfy your greed.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.355
Gosh. What a brat.

00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:19.625
When has anything ever gone wrong when you took my advice?

00:12:21.294 --> 00:12:22.294
Never.

00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:25.005
Thanks to you, I met Ms. Seo.

00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:26.334
Yes. So you went to a prestigious university...

00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:27.664
and got a nice job.

00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:30.375
I helped you get everything you would need to have a good life.

00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:33.145
Then how could you say harsh things about my effort?

00:12:34.615 --> 00:12:35.775
Will you keep this up?

00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:40.785
If I start fighting back without showing any mercy on you,

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:43.755
you'll end up in tears.

Mom. Here. Smack me.

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.755
And stop worrying about me.

00:13:17.584 --> 00:13:20.755
I raised you without ever laying a hand on you.

00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:26.525
I'll call Dad.

00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:29.194
Don't bring this up to him. He might take it out on you.

00:13:29.794 --> 00:13:31.204
Tell him I'll give him a call.

I've been thinking all night.

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.844
Something doesn't feel right.

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:53.405
What do you mean?

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:56.875
I'm talking about the schoolteacher...

00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:00.684

It's Pyo Sang Seob.

00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:07.625
It's odd that he personally came to our academy.

00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:10.094
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.794
I should meet with him once.

00:16:13.895 --> 00:16:16.395
Perhaps, he has a selling point we're not aware of.

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:19.064
He had been a schoolteacher for 20 years.

00:16:19.564 --> 00:16:22.275
He won't be able to compete against academy instructors.

00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:27.304
Ms. Woo. You know what a hand plough is, right?

00:16:29.174 --> 00:16:31.174
You know, the tool you use for farming.

00:16:31.174 --> 00:16:32.844
- I see. Yes. - The hand plough.

00:16:33.544 --> 00:16:35.885
Apparently, that tool sells like hotcakes in the US.

00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:38.954
Every house has a garden in the US.

00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:41.084
Those Americans had struggled to dig up...

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.954
the garden with trowels.

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:45.694
They had a taste of the new world with our hand ploughs.

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:50.895
Thanks to that, the blacksmiths in the countryside...

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.605
are thrilled...

00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:54.564
that our hand ploughs are in such high demand.

00:16:55.934 --> 00:16:57.005
Are you saying...

00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:01.304
I'm just pointing out that...

00:17:02.115 --> 00:17:03.414
the value of the products...

00:17:03.414 --> 00:17:05.914
may differ based on who uses them,

Let's recruit him if our conditions match.

00:17:25.705 --> 00:17:27.165
But we can't let him take Ms. Seo's students...

00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:28.634
from Chanyoung High. Why would we...

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:31.374

By any chance,

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:39.584
do you also have Ms. Seo's next position in mind?

00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:41.554
Like a promotion, perhaps?

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:45.624
I hope you're not disappointed.

00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:50.695
That I always stick up for Ms. Seo...

00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:52.465
instead of taking your advice.

00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:55.394
I am disappointed.

00:17:56.564 --> 00:17:57.564
Pardon?

00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.134
I have a stronger sense of ownership in what I do than anyone else.

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.374
I don't let my personal feelings get in the way of my work.

Goodness.

00:18:07.144 --> 00:18:09.844
If that's how you interpreted what I said, I'm the disappointed one.

She thought it was homework, so she did it.

No, that's not true.

00:20:39.294 --> 00:20:40.894

The book reading...

00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:51.175
I couldn't read a long novel because it was too hard.

00:20:52.144 --> 00:20:54.505
But I read a few short stories.

00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:00.415
How did you choose the short stories?

00:21:00.915 --> 00:21:04.415
There was a list in the back of the textbook...

00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:06.985

No, it's not like that.

00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:26.005
Perhaps, I was just wondering...

00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:29.144
if you could check what I wrote in your spare time.

To see if there was a selling point that we don't know about.

I don't know...

00:28:56.105 --> 00:28:57.645
how it feels to say that stuff,

00:28:59.014 --> 00:29:00.645
but the one hearing it sometimes gets choked up.

00:29:04.444 --> 00:29:05.484
Goodness.

Were you disappointed?

00:29:10.554 --> 00:29:11.724
It must just be a habit.

00:29:19.964 --> 00:29:21.335
You're also going to do something...

00:29:21.964 --> 00:29:23.734
about Mr. Pyo Sang Seob without telling me, right?

00:29:27.835 --> 00:29:28.875
Well...

00:29:35.214 --> 00:29:37.085
Mr. Pyo is going to give a free lecture.

00:29:37.615 --> 00:29:38.915
I'm sure he'll prepare something...

00:29:38.915 --> 00:29:40.254
totally different from his lessons at school.

00:29:41.454 --> 00:29:43.724
I was thinking that the kids should hear that lecture,

00:29:43.724 --> 00:29:45.024
and that I should help them...

00:29:45.395 --> 00:29:46.595
make a decision.

00:29:47.855 --> 00:29:48.865
It makes no sense.

00:29:50.264 --> 00:29:51.764
Director Choi Hyung Sun once told me...

00:29:52.794 --> 00:29:54.435
that she and I are alike in a way.

00:29:55.734 --> 00:29:57.135
My gosh.

00:29:57.905 --> 00:29:59.474
Gosh, how infuriating.

00:29:59.474 --> 00:30:01.944
If I were Director Choi, I wouldn't say...

00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:04.345
that Mr. Pyo has a long career as a lecturer. Two years at most?

00:30:06.315 --> 00:30:07.474
But that shouldn't be the case.

00:30:08.784 --> 00:30:09.815
So?

00:30:09.815 --> 00:30:12.954
Should I send a group message to my students and promote his lecture?

00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:15.284
Or should I go in front of the school and kneel?

00:30:16.724 --> 00:30:18.454
Or should I just ask him to come to our academy?

00:30:19.024 --> 00:30:20.254
I'm still thinking about it.

00:30:20.554 --> 00:30:22.325
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:24.524
If you cause the academy the least bit of loss...

00:30:24.524 --> 00:30:26.194
I know. I do, but...

00:30:26.865 --> 00:30:28.734
even if I want to lose to him, it's hard to do that.

00:30:28.734 --> 00:30:30.004
That's what I'm worried about.

00:30:31.234 --> 00:30:33.905
Chanyoung High has been in my hands even back when you went there.

00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:36.504
Customer loyalty is way too high.

00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:38.204
You changed Si Woo's mind.

00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:40.474
He turned his back on Choisun Academy...

00:30:40.474 --> 00:30:41.474
who had Heewon High in their hands for 20 years.

00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.845
Gosh, we just got lucky on that.

00:30:45.315 --> 00:30:46.784
I don't think of it as luck.

00:30:49.355 --> 00:30:51.125
Out of all the things I accomplished...

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:52.155
since I first met you,

00:30:53.724 --> 00:30:55.264
nothing was just by luck.

00:30:58.194 --> 00:31:01.095
Seo Hye Jin is a smart person.

00:31:01.365 --> 00:31:02.935
She has a quick mind and has talent too.

00:31:04.135 --> 00:31:07.075
I envy you for having a teacher like that.

00:31:07.835 --> 00:31:08.845
However,

00:31:09.544 --> 00:31:12.175
she can be a bit rude. And she doesn't fear anything.

00:31:14.014 --> 00:31:16.444
I've been doing this for 20 years.

00:31:17.415 --> 00:31:20.085
Out of all the teachers who teach that many students,

00:31:20.085 --> 00:31:23.254
I haven't seen very many who also have good manners.

00:31:29.194 --> 00:31:31.625
Then, was the reason why you hired Mr. Pyo Sang Seob...

00:31:32.034 --> 00:31:34.264
because you wanted to fix Seo Hye Jin's rude attitude?

00:31:34.264 --> 00:31:35.935
Gosh, no.

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.405
I'm a saleswoman.

00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:40.734
What else would I want than to get more students?

00:31:43.544 --> 00:31:45.974
The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!

00:31:47.944 --> 00:31:48.944
Gosh.

00:31:49.714 --> 00:31:52.085
Had I seen that advertisement beforehand,

00:31:52.355 --> 00:31:54.815
it would never have made it onto the streets.

00:31:55.355 --> 00:31:57.054
Seo Hye Jin crossed the line way too far.

00:31:57.554 --> 00:31:59.125
And she doesn't have...

00:31:59.254 --> 00:32:01.655
any respect for a senior in the field nor any business morality.

00:32:04.895 --> 00:32:08.034
When you swallowed your pride and offered to hire her,

00:32:08.034 --> 00:32:09.935
you must've promised her the best treatment.

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:11.974
But I'm sure, with her attitude,

00:32:11.974 --> 00:32:13.905
she would've turned you down with some pretty rude comments.

00:32:13.905 --> 00:32:14.935
I know her very well.

00:32:17.304 --> 00:32:19.875
If it were me, I wouldn't forgive her.

00:32:20.774 --> 00:32:22.744
There's no use in wallowing in the past.

00:32:23.444 --> 00:32:25.514
Even you forgive and go on living...

00:32:26.115 --> 00:32:28.415
as you work for Kim Hyun Tak, a younger and less experienced boss.

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:33.524
The story of how Kim Hyun Tak trampled on Victory Academy...

00:32:33.524 --> 00:32:34.994
and acquired it for a cheap price...

00:32:35.565 --> 00:32:36.925
I thought he was a cowardly act.

00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:41.135
You must've been devastated, but you endured it well.

00:32:43.034 --> 00:32:44.065
But I...

00:32:44.804 --> 00:32:46.974
am the type to wallow in the past.

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:51.645
I want to go back to where I belong now.

00:32:54.774 --> 00:32:57.645
You've held out long. Has it been about seven years?

00:32:57.645 --> 00:32:58.754
It's nine years.

00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:02.024
It's been 8 years and 7 months, to be exact.

00:33:02.024 --> 00:33:03.925
Goodness, where has the time gone?

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:08.494
Then, you should take at least half of the students with you.

00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:09.665
Gosh.

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:11.994
That won't be enough...

00:33:12.494 --> 00:33:14.135
if you consider the interest.

00:33:22.544 --> 00:33:24.605
Ten years worth of Seo Hye Jin's lecture curricula.

00:33:25.544 --> 00:33:27.274
Reference materials, past exam questions,

00:33:27.274 --> 00:33:29.685
test papers, question trends per teacher,

00:33:29.685 --> 00:33:32.385
original files of her textbooks, and counselling notes. Everything.

00:33:33.284 --> 00:33:36.325
Oh, and there are phone numbers of her past assistants too.

00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:38.524
And they're the updated versions.

00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:43.264
You've brought me...

00:33:44.194 --> 00:33:45.895
Seo Hye Jin's head.

00:33:47.335 --> 00:33:50.165
But she's not that easy to take down,

00:33:50.165 --> 00:33:51.264
sadly enough.

00:33:51.435 --> 00:33:53.474
- That is true. - However,

00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:57.974
I think it would be possible under current circumstances.

00:33:59.274 --> 00:34:01.875
Seo Hye Jin is unlike her past self.

00:34:03.044 --> 00:34:04.815
She gave up her spot for an advertisement.

00:34:05.014 --> 00:34:06.984
She gave a free lecture.

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:09.524
And she even took a whole weekend off...

00:34:09.524 --> 00:34:10.984
saying she wasn't feeling well.

00:34:22.304 --> 00:34:23.935
I'm curious about two things.

00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:28.335
Yes. Feel free to ask me.

00:34:28.335 --> 00:34:29.344
First.

00:34:30.474 --> 00:34:32.645
Why are you going after Seo Hye Jin's head?

00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:35.715
Isn't Director Kim Hyun Tak your target?

00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:39.685
Even if I shake up the academy in a huge way,

00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.224
it's only a matter of time...

00:34:42.485 --> 00:34:45.324
for Kim Hyun Tak to get back on his feet with Seo Hye Jin standing.

00:34:46.724 --> 00:34:48.454
Once, Seo Hye Jin was forced to give up...

00:34:48.454 --> 00:34:50.924
some of her students to another teacher.

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:54.295
Still, Seo Hye Jin wasn't affected by it at all.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:55.735
No. In fact,

00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:58.605
it was as if someone had woken an angry viper by accident.

00:34:58.835 --> 00:35:00.174
She became even more confident.

00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:01.674
One should just...

00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.074
cut her out.

00:35:07.114 --> 00:35:09.744
And what is the reason for giving me these materials?

00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:12.384
Oh, well...

00:35:12.715 --> 00:35:14.185
To be exact,

00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:16.284
I'm not giving these to you but to Mr. Pyo.

00:35:16.284 --> 00:35:18.625
I thought he'd make the best use of these.

00:35:19.554 --> 00:35:21.654
Well, in the long run,

00:35:21.924 --> 00:35:24.965
you and I are competitors too.

00:35:25.534 --> 00:35:28.034
It'd be detrimental for me if you have these materials.

00:35:29.704 --> 00:35:32.304
If Mr. Pyo comes in person,

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:34.204
I will let him access the files.

00:35:34.534 --> 00:35:36.545
Tell him to save it in his head.

00:35:39.775 --> 00:35:43.384
And what happens if I tell Mr. Kim Hyun Tak...

00:35:43.514 --> 00:35:44.844
about this?

00:35:53.554 --> 00:35:56.125
That would be a huge loss for you.

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:59.594
You'd have to get rid of this studio apartment first,

00:36:00.364 --> 00:36:03.465
and your academy would take a hit as well.

00:36:10.204 --> 00:36:12.844
But, no matter how I think about this,

00:36:13.014 --> 00:36:14.545
it's too huge a present.

00:36:15.585 --> 00:36:16.585
Do I really...

00:36:17.244 --> 00:36:19.654
have to trample on Seo Hye Jin and nothing more?

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:24.154
Of course.

00:36:28.295 --> 00:36:31.795
(Heeya Sliced Raw Bottom Round Steak)

00:37:12.775 --> 00:37:13.804
Let's go.

00:37:13.935 --> 00:37:15.775
Come to think of it, your textbooks are going to print soon.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:16.945
We don't have time for this.

00:37:20.315 --> 00:37:21.315
What's up?

00:37:23.344 --> 00:37:24.784
It's nothing. Let's go.

00:37:28.085 --> 00:37:29.424
You seem a bit off today.

00:37:32.654 --> 00:37:34.625
I thought you wouldn't hang out with me for a while,

00:37:34.824 --> 00:37:36.065
so I was just watching you.

00:37:39.565 --> 00:37:41.364
Don't worry too much about Mr. Pyo.

00:37:42.034 --> 00:37:43.335
I'll deal with it myself.

00:37:47.375 --> 00:37:48.375
Okay.

00:38:05.355 --> 00:38:06.424
Thank you for the meal.

00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:11.065
I came to repay the debt for giving me a ride home.

00:38:11.065 --> 00:38:12.094
No need to thank me.

00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:14.494
Don't you like cafeteria food?

00:38:15.034 --> 00:38:16.904
What? I don't dislike it.

00:38:18.105 --> 00:38:20.275
I was grateful for this back when I was a student.

00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:22.974
You must've been poor.

00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:26.945
How could you ask me that so casually?

00:38:29.244 --> 00:38:30.344
It's in the past tense.

00:38:33.315 --> 00:38:35.454
That's better than me. I'm poor right now.

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:38.025
I've been curious for a while.

00:38:38.384 --> 00:38:39.395
Yes?

00:38:39.795 --> 00:38:41.255
Do you regret choosing to study more?

00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:46.665
By now, 9 out of 10 people say that they regret it,

00:38:48.364 --> 00:38:49.404
but I don't.

00:38:49.404 --> 00:38:50.534
Because you have rich parents?

00:38:51.605 --> 00:38:52.904
You don't have to worry about making a living?

00:38:53.605 --> 00:38:54.904
No, it's not like that.

00:38:56.574 --> 00:38:58.704
If I give up on marriage or having kids,

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:00.445
I can take care of myself...

00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:03.045
on my own.

00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:05.985
Is that why you gave up dating too?

00:39:07.185 --> 00:39:08.215
What?

00:39:09.154 --> 00:39:10.224
What do you mean?

00:39:11.185 --> 00:39:12.494
I want to date.

00:39:13.654 --> 00:39:14.695
Forget it, then.

00:39:18.465 --> 00:39:19.935
There's someone I like too.

00:39:20.864 --> 00:39:21.864
I didn't ask.

00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:26.204
I heard she was about three years older than me.

00:39:29.704 --> 00:39:31.844
But she said she wasn't interested in younger guys,

00:39:32.844 --> 00:39:34.145
so I'm just scoping things out...

00:39:36.344 --> 00:39:37.344
by taking her to eat at the cafeteria.

00:39:53.295 --> 00:39:54.534
Try dating me.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:57.835
I won't be able to buy you expensive meals,

00:39:58.735 --> 00:40:00.134
but I can make life fun for you.

00:40:01.904 --> 00:40:03.474
What if I want to eat expensive meals?

00:40:06.574 --> 00:40:07.945
We can have Lee Jun Ho pay for that.

00:40:09.014 --> 00:40:10.614
I have a huge weakness of his.

00:40:11.744 --> 00:40:14.915
I don't think this would even make it to the director.

00:40:14.915 --> 00:40:17.255
I think the vice-director would turn it down first.

00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:20.025
Even with just two kids to sign up for a lecture,

00:40:20.025 --> 00:40:21.395
some academies open up the class.

00:40:21.954 --> 00:40:24.165
The minimum number of students I'm asking for is four.

00:40:24.395 --> 00:40:25.895
The regulation enforcement has become more rigid,

00:40:25.895 --> 00:40:28.235
so everyone has been splitting up large lectures into smaller ones.

00:40:28.235 --> 00:40:29.534
There are no lecture rooms.

00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:31.634
There aren't very many left, but it's not like there are none.

00:40:35.275 --> 00:40:38.645
We don't do small lectures.

00:40:39.715 --> 00:40:41.045
I think you already know why.

00:40:43.815 --> 00:40:45.315
The new lecturers...

00:40:45.645 --> 00:40:47.915
signed the contract with a monthly pay system for the first year.

00:40:48.355 --> 00:40:49.824
No matter how many students you teach.

00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:51.554
you're getting quite a large paycheck.

00:40:51.554 --> 00:40:52.954
Do you think you'd even cover...

00:40:52.954 --> 00:40:55.625
the cost of using a classroom, your expenses, and all that?

00:40:56.025 --> 00:40:57.494
And you use so much paper too.

00:40:58.295 --> 00:40:59.795
I'm not saying I'd only teach four kids.

00:40:59.795 --> 00:41:02.165
I'm saying let me open the class as long as I get four to sign up.

00:41:03.165 --> 00:41:05.634
There's something I want to do, and I can make it a huge hit.

00:41:08.105 --> 00:41:09.744
What do you want to do?

00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:11.174
Teach great lectures.

00:41:17.315 --> 00:41:19.715
I want to believe you, but...

00:41:19.715 --> 00:41:20.815
I don't mind if there are no windows.

00:41:20.815 --> 00:41:22.554
It can be a room in the corner.

00:41:24.784 --> 00:41:26.625
This is going to be a headache.

00:41:27.654 --> 00:41:30.125
I'll ask about the classroom,

00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:32.324
but then...

00:41:33.395 --> 00:41:36.404
I won't know if what you're teaching is right or good.

00:41:37.005 --> 00:41:39.534
Write something down.

00:41:40.005 --> 00:41:42.404
Even as a formality,

00:41:42.404 --> 00:41:44.074
bring something on a piece of paper...

00:41:44.074 --> 00:41:46.114
if you want to please the people high up.

00:41:46.275 --> 00:41:48.474
- Okay. - Make sure you have that.

00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:50.215
Sincerity.

00:41:51.485 --> 00:41:54.415
I'm this free only a few days a year.

00:41:55.815 --> 00:41:58.355
I get to relax just a few days before the vacation starts.

00:41:59.025 --> 00:42:01.855
You must know I work until late every day.

00:42:04.364 --> 00:42:06.994
Do you know what the strength of people who like to study is?

00:42:08.435 --> 00:42:09.534
They do just fine on their own.

00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:19.005
- What's that? - An alarm.

00:42:20.215 --> 00:42:23.485
You don't have to take medication on time, do you?

00:42:24.784 --> 00:42:26.384
I decided to slack off only until right now.

00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:28.255
What?

00:42:29.985 --> 00:42:32.324
We were discussing something very important.

00:42:32.755 --> 00:42:33.824
And you're leaving?

00:42:33.824 --> 00:42:35.924
I have to proofread my material once more before it goes to print.

00:42:38.795 --> 00:42:39.795
Gosh.

00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:44.435
I thought I was pretty good and making others flustered.

00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:46.704
Have fun on your own.

00:42:47.735 --> 00:42:48.735
You said you did that just fine.

00:42:50.145 --> 00:42:51.145
But...

00:42:51.145 --> 00:42:53.014
Bye. You don't have to get up.

00:42:55.945 --> 00:42:57.415
I can proofread too.

00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:01.315
I read over 1,000 pages of our professors' papers...

00:43:07.054 --> 00:43:10.364
(Chanyoung High School, 1st Year, Sung Ha Yul)

00:43:24.844 --> 00:43:25.844
You're still here?

00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:29.275
What?

00:43:31.114 --> 00:43:32.145
I should go.

00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:38.424
The principal will ask to see you tomorrow.

00:43:39.395 --> 00:43:40.395
Okay.

00:43:45.695 --> 00:43:47.065
Shall we get a drink?

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:52.364
Next time. I'll treat you then.

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:55.105
I have stuff to do today.

00:43:56.674 --> 00:43:57.704
Okay.

00:44:02.315 --> 00:44:04.315
(Chanyoung High School, 1st Year, Sung Ha Yul)

00:44:05.614 --> 00:44:08.514
(Challenge! Read a book a semester!)

00:44:25.364 --> 00:44:26.404
Hello?

00:44:26.974 --> 00:44:29.174
There's too much. It's confusing.

00:44:29.174 --> 00:44:30.174
I see.

00:44:30.844 --> 00:44:31.904
He's the one...

00:44:32.844 --> 00:44:35.174
who made this choice.

00:44:35.744 --> 00:44:37.344
All I did was make an offer.

00:44:38.485 --> 00:44:39.514
An offer...

00:44:39.514 --> 00:44:41.315
- Are you here? - Fill it in.

00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:43.085
- Come to the fifth floor. - The poet.

00:44:43.085 --> 00:44:44.255
Okay.

00:44:44.255 --> 00:44:46.695
Yes. It's here at last.

00:44:47.494 --> 00:44:49.724
The courier brought Mr. Lee's and my sample textbooks.

00:44:49.724 --> 00:44:50.795
See you.

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:00.034
Okay?

00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:02.534
The next question.

00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:13.355
What are you doing?

00:45:14.154 --> 00:45:16.654
I was going through some material.

00:45:18.824 --> 00:45:20.554
That material.

00:45:21.855 --> 00:45:24.924
Isn't it something one shouldn't share or try to take a peek at?

00:45:27.295 --> 00:45:28.335
Vice-director.

00:45:29.735 --> 00:45:30.735
Yes?

00:45:32.005 --> 00:45:33.534
I feel the need...

00:45:33.534 --> 00:45:36.545
for you to view your situation more objectively.

00:45:39.645 --> 00:45:40.815
Imagine this.

00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:43.114
An older man...

00:45:43.114 --> 00:45:46.045
who could've stayed on and retired as...

00:45:46.255 --> 00:45:47.815
a middling schoolteacher.

00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:53.654
He also happened to have been taught a harsh lesson by an instructor,

00:45:53.924 --> 00:45:56.364
and he decided to challenge her.

00:45:56.895 --> 00:45:58.065
At an academy.

00:45:59.835 --> 00:46:01.665
Your first opponent is Seo Hye Jin.

00:46:02.904 --> 00:46:06.404
She teaches 300 Chanyoung High students each year.

00:46:07.235 --> 00:46:09.474
Kids who live and study here are picky,

00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:12.005
and she has their utmost support.

00:46:12.005 --> 00:46:13.074
I'm aware of...

00:46:13.574 --> 00:46:15.875
my situation and what I must do.

00:46:16.415 --> 00:46:17.985
- Are you really? - Yes.

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:20.784
So I'll prepare as best I can...

00:46:24.654 --> 00:46:26.654
You don't seem to know.

00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:32.665
Preparing as best you can...

00:46:32.665 --> 00:46:34.065
is a given. It's so basic.

00:46:35.895 --> 00:46:38.165
What else must I do?

00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:42.235
What I need you to do is win.

00:46:42.904 --> 00:46:45.445
A 99-percent win rate won't do it for me.

00:46:45.704 --> 00:46:47.045
It must be 100 percent.

00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:52.744
"The results will reflect the hard work..."

00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:54.454
"I put in, so I'll just do my best."

00:46:55.284 --> 00:46:58.554
You don't have that naive mindset, do you?

00:46:58.954 --> 00:47:02.324
I have more than enough teaching material.

00:47:41.264 --> 00:47:42.764
What's this?

00:47:43.364 --> 00:47:44.634
The left is from last year's...

00:47:44.634 --> 00:47:47.574
second-semester final exam for Chanyoung High's tenth grade.

00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:52.375
The right is a question Seo Hye Jin told her students to study in case.

00:47:53.215 --> 00:47:56.415
She recommended and got right a passage that wasn't in...

00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:58.985
the textbook or any secondary teaching material.

00:48:00.255 --> 00:48:01.654
The multiple choice options are different,

00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:04.384
but how excited do you think...

00:48:04.384 --> 00:48:06.054
the students were when they saw that?

00:48:08.125 --> 00:48:11.724
And how many more students do you think flocked to her classes?

00:48:13.335 --> 00:48:16.134
That happens almost every semester.

00:48:16.134 --> 00:48:17.165
Now...

00:48:17.864 --> 00:48:22.134
do you see who exactly you're up against?

00:48:25.744 --> 00:48:26.775
Yes.

00:48:26.775 --> 00:48:29.344
This is what you will see in the material that was offered.

00:48:30.445 --> 00:48:33.855
The school's exam trend, the KSAT pattern,

00:48:33.855 --> 00:48:35.884
the personal taste and style of each teacher,

00:48:35.884 --> 00:48:37.884
the change in that teacher's taste,

00:48:37.884 --> 00:48:39.795
even all the mock exam questions.

00:48:40.424 --> 00:48:42.395
It will all be there.

00:48:42.824 --> 00:48:45.324
Naturally, you'll be able to learn how Seo Hye Jin...

00:48:45.424 --> 00:48:47.094
decides what to expect in each exam.

00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:50.335
But you're...

00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:52.835
not playing fair.

00:48:54.674 --> 00:48:56.574
It's only against the rules if the referee notices.

00:48:56.875 --> 00:49:00.415
Who will say it's unfair if no one sees it?

00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:08.114
I met up...

00:49:08.784 --> 00:49:11.625
with Seo Hye Jin and shook her up.

00:49:13.125 --> 00:49:16.594
I told her you would be quite a threat.

00:49:24.735 --> 00:49:28.534
At midnight tonight, go to the place on the note.

00:49:29.435 --> 00:49:32.105
Vice-director Woo Seung Hui will be waiting.

00:49:41.705 --> 00:49:43.234
- Where are you going? - To the library.

00:49:43.234 --> 00:49:45.075
To help the new instructors proofread their textbooks.

00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:48.444
They must fend for themselves. Why would you help?

00:49:48.575 --> 00:49:50.415
She can help if she wants.

00:49:51.475 --> 00:49:52.615
Why are you throwing it out?

00:49:53.444 --> 00:49:54.484
Because I don't need it.

00:49:55.185 --> 00:49:56.185
Wait. This is...

00:49:56.185 --> 00:49:58.555
We just have to send it to the printer tomorrow.

00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:00.984
Why are you shredding this?

00:50:02.354 --> 00:50:04.424
It's useless. I'm going to start over.

00:50:05.624 --> 00:50:06.725
Why?

00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:08.895
Because you can find...

00:50:09.225 --> 00:50:11.765
a hundred thousand books like this in Daechi-dong.

00:50:13.705 --> 00:50:15.464
No, wait.

00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:18.874
Why are you doing this?

I rarely get angry,

00:51:22.234 --> 00:51:24.374
but yesterday, I got so angry I almost died.

00:51:24.535 --> 00:51:26.174
What happened yesterday?

00:51:26.705 --> 00:51:29.205
I barged in to see Choisun Academy's director...

00:51:29.205 --> 00:51:30.544
and got beaten up.

00:51:30.714 --> 00:51:31.774
What?

00:51:31.944 --> 00:51:34.415
What? No, don't be so surprised. She beat me up verbally.

00:51:35.515 --> 00:51:37.254
I couldn't stand or accept...

00:51:37.254 --> 00:51:38.984
what Choi Hyung Sun said to Ms. Seo.

00:51:40.354 --> 00:51:41.424
"Okay, fine."

00:51:42.124 --> 00:51:43.254
"You ruined our free lecture,"

00:51:43.254 --> 00:51:44.654
"scouted a schoolteacher,"

00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:47.395
"talked crap, and tried to pull tricks."

00:51:47.395 --> 00:51:48.464
"Do whatever you want."

00:51:48.895 --> 00:51:50.464
"It's the class that students pick."

00:51:50.464 --> 00:51:51.595
"I'll pay you back with my teaching."

00:51:53.705 --> 00:51:55.265
So I looked at the material I'd made.

00:51:55.464 --> 00:51:56.734
And what?

00:51:58.475 --> 00:52:00.075
I wasn't good enough to make her pay.

00:52:02.245 --> 00:52:04.274
No, it's good work.

00:52:04.615 --> 00:52:06.115
Classes start soon.

00:52:06.115 --> 00:52:08.015
Call the printer and ask for another copy.

00:52:08.015 --> 00:52:10.214
- If you get it couriered... - I'll make the materials again.

00:52:11.055 --> 00:52:12.214
There's no time.

00:52:13.225 --> 00:52:15.854
I don't need fancy designs or expensive paper.

00:52:15.955 --> 00:52:17.395
I didn't learn with that.

00:52:17.595 --> 00:52:19.794
Think of how crappy your first teaching materials were.

00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:21.325
Mr. Lee.

00:52:21.424 --> 00:52:22.694
Si Woo said that...

00:52:23.535 --> 00:52:25.495
unlike other subjects, when he studies Korean,

00:52:25.895 --> 00:52:27.865
it feels like he's not well-prepared.

00:52:27.865 --> 00:52:29.234
He's left with a bad aftertaste.

00:52:29.435 --> 00:52:31.805
That's because he's just a tenth-grader...

00:52:31.805 --> 00:52:34.745
You can't eliminate that aftertaste with a common approach.

00:52:34.745 --> 00:52:37.075
It's common because it was tried and tested.

00:52:37.345 --> 00:52:38.814
I came up with a new full-mark strategy.

00:52:39.415 --> 00:52:42.185
It worked on eighth-class me and first-class me.

00:52:42.285 --> 00:52:43.685
What is he on about?

00:52:44.615 --> 00:52:45.955
I'll teach them how to read.

00:52:46.754 --> 00:52:49.624
They need to form muscles so they can tackle any passage.

00:52:50.524 --> 00:52:52.495
Forget teaching skills on how to get things right.

00:52:52.495 --> 00:52:53.495
We must teach the essence.

00:52:54.124 --> 00:52:55.395
I can get them to read...

00:52:55.395 --> 00:52:57.635
and instinctively find the correct answer.

00:52:58.194 --> 00:53:00.035
They just have to follow me patiently.

00:53:00.765 --> 00:53:03.504
Kids with poor grades will improve much more,

00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:07.075
and kids with good grades can trust in themselves.

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:09.345
What kind of dreamy nonsense is this?

00:53:10.245 --> 00:53:13.415
The smart kids will consider me a mentor.

00:53:14.314 --> 00:53:16.584
Because they'll know it'll help them for the rest of their lives.

00:53:19.685 --> 00:53:21.725
You won't play with me for a while.

00:53:24.024 --> 00:53:25.024
Gosh.

00:53:25.794 --> 00:53:28.694
I think your judgment is clouded because of me.

00:53:28.694 --> 00:53:29.794
I'm sorry.

00:53:30.365 --> 00:53:31.794
I shouldn't have said that.

00:53:31.964 --> 00:53:34.935
You can get bored if you stare at this for days.

00:53:35.035 --> 00:53:36.834
Send it to me. I'll proofread it for you.

00:53:36.935 --> 00:53:38.635
Stop saying you'll do things for me.

00:53:38.635 --> 00:53:41.174
Okay, then. Let's look through it together.

00:53:41.174 --> 00:53:42.904
- Send me the file first. - I deleted it.

00:53:44.814 --> 00:53:45.874
It's not funny.

00:53:46.544 --> 00:53:48.145
- I'm serious. - Lee Jun Ho!

00:53:54.084 --> 00:53:55.185
Are they fighting?

00:53:56.854 --> 00:53:59.095
Wait. Ms. Seo.

00:54:00.124 --> 00:54:02.225
We still have most of the first draft...

00:54:02.325 --> 00:54:03.964
and the file on the printing company's cloud.

00:54:03.964 --> 00:54:05.595
We can restore everything.

00:54:06.395 --> 00:54:08.064
Do you think teaching kids is a joke?

00:54:08.665 --> 00:54:09.805
Excuse me.

00:54:09.805 --> 00:54:11.374
I'm telling you this because it's not.

00:54:11.404 --> 00:54:13.245
You destroyed a textbook you worked on all semester.

00:54:14.145 --> 00:54:15.145
How is it not a joke?

00:54:15.145 --> 00:54:17.544
We need a new curriculum if we're to teach properly.

00:54:17.544 --> 00:54:19.314
- Don't let your emotions take over. - Go back inside.

00:54:19.314 --> 00:54:21.745
Be responsible. Forget about lifelong benefits.

00:54:23.115 --> 00:54:24.185
Don't belittle me.

00:54:24.814 --> 00:54:26.955
What's this about essence and being able to read?

00:54:27.424 --> 00:54:28.955
If you want to stress that, go into politics.

00:54:28.955 --> 00:54:30.495
You're smart. Take the civil service exam.

00:54:30.495 --> 00:54:31.895
Ditch the sarcasm.

00:54:31.895 --> 00:54:33.765
It's the same as saying you'll cancel the KSAT!

00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:36.395
Will you follow every kid when they take an exam?

00:54:36.964 --> 00:54:39.464
What if they come across a question that your skills don't work on?

00:54:40.404 --> 00:54:43.404
Will you coax each flustered kid and walk them through the passage?

00:54:44.975 --> 00:54:47.944
There's no true first class until the kids are able to read...

00:54:47.944 --> 00:54:49.444
and tackle any question on their own.

00:54:49.544 --> 00:54:50.615
Saying that means...

00:54:50.615 --> 00:54:52.544
there's no correct answer to teaching Korean.

00:54:53.685 --> 00:54:56.515
I don't want to persuade or convince people who think so.

00:54:57.154 --> 00:54:59.314
At school, the schoolteachers decide what's right or wrong.

00:54:59.455 --> 00:55:01.285
There's a whole organization behind the KSAT.

00:55:01.285 --> 00:55:03.254
You said they would need to follow you patiently.

00:55:03.254 --> 00:55:06.555
- That's a massive topic. - That's the same as failing to...

00:55:06.555 --> 00:55:07.665
- achieve short-term results. - Mr. Lee.

00:55:08.194 --> 00:55:09.665
- Trust me... - He's cooler when he's defiant.

00:55:09.665 --> 00:55:11.194
How many exams are there in a year?

00:55:11.194 --> 00:55:13.194
A mock exam, the midterms, a mock exam, the finals.

00:55:13.194 --> 00:55:14.265
That happens each semester.

00:55:14.265 --> 00:55:16.104
Ms. Seo talks down on him a bit too much.

00:55:16.205 --> 00:55:17.774
They're both instructors if you think about it.

00:55:17.774 --> 00:55:19.274
That rules their life forever.

00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:23.714
We need to show obvious results and fast.

00:55:24.615 --> 00:55:26.214
Do you brag that you went to a great university?

00:55:30.754 --> 00:55:31.885
I don't.

00:55:31.885 --> 00:55:34.825
With that degree, you worked at a huge company and now you're here.

00:55:34.825 --> 00:55:37.495
And then what? If this fails, you can try something else.

00:55:37.495 --> 00:55:39.325
You know what a degree means.

00:55:39.325 --> 00:55:41.325
It's a status that follows you around forever.

00:55:41.694 --> 00:55:44.294
Just one question could change their future status...

00:55:44.294 --> 00:55:45.395
and you're talking nonsense?

00:55:45.395 --> 00:55:47.365
Getting one more question right in a Korean exam?

00:55:48.535 --> 00:55:50.604
That's not my goal. My goal is...

00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:53.475
to help the kids get better grades in every subject.

00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:54.904
Then teach elementary school kids.

00:55:54.904 --> 00:55:56.374
Teach Korean, math, social studies, and science.

00:55:56.374 --> 00:55:57.475
Teach music and PE too!

00:55:57.475 --> 00:56:00.415
You need to think about why you're my forever mentor!

00:56:05.115 --> 00:56:06.615
While you taught me,

00:56:07.385 --> 00:56:08.754
my grades improved overall.

00:56:09.325 --> 00:56:12.154
You know better than anyone how that happened.

00:56:13.154 --> 00:56:15.464
We teach the most basic subject.

00:56:16.194 --> 00:56:17.294
"Hong Kyung Rae's Revolt?"

00:56:17.734 --> 00:56:19.964
Kids read the title and think something revolting's going on.

00:56:19.964 --> 00:56:22.665
Giving them a book, telling them what question to memorize,

00:56:22.665 --> 00:56:25.705
and telling them to circle words? What's the point in that?

00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:28.874
I'll teach the language first.

00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:31.475
I'll expand their horizons and get them to imagine.

00:56:31.814 --> 00:56:33.685
If we teach tenth-graders to understand vocab,

00:56:33.685 --> 00:56:35.845
sentences, passages, then how to read between the lines,

00:56:36.044 --> 00:56:38.314
their status that you talked about will change!

00:56:38.314 --> 00:56:40.185
If you follow that step each time,

00:56:40.185 --> 00:56:41.754
how many passages can you go through per class?

00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:42.785
Who cares...

00:56:43.424 --> 00:56:45.354
Who cares how many we manage?

00:56:45.354 --> 00:56:47.225
It'll be slow at first, but we'll pick up speed.

00:56:47.225 --> 00:56:48.694
Do you think parents pay...

00:56:48.694 --> 00:56:51.194
hundreds of dollars per subject for you to teach that?

00:56:51.294 --> 00:56:54.334
My gosh. I can hear them weep from here.

00:56:55.104 --> 00:56:56.135
It's cheap.

00:56:56.504 --> 00:56:57.774
The skill will last forever.

00:56:57.774 --> 00:57:00.035
This is an academy for teens. It's not a lifelong learning centre.

00:57:00.205 --> 00:57:02.044
Excuse me.

00:57:02.475 --> 00:57:04.714
You both need to cool down.

00:57:06.015 --> 00:57:07.915
I'm glad you said that.

00:57:08.785 --> 00:57:10.814
Go outside and get some air.

00:57:10.814 --> 00:57:13.385
And see how many academies there are in a 100m radius.

00:57:13.584 --> 00:57:16.685
If your method worked, they would have no reason to exist.

00:57:17.024 --> 00:57:19.194
Their parents would keep kids home to read.

00:57:19.725 --> 00:57:22.725
Your method never worked since entrance exams were created,

00:57:22.725 --> 00:57:24.035
and it never will work!

00:57:24.035 --> 00:57:26.234
I'll do what the parents can't.

00:57:26.564 --> 00:57:28.935
It's the only way one of my students will be the best in the country.

00:57:28.935 --> 00:57:30.734
That's what worked for me,

00:57:30.834 --> 00:57:32.734
and I'll teach what worked for me.

00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:34.845
What worked for you ten years ago?

00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:36.374
Are you going to be drunk on that forever?

00:57:36.374 --> 00:57:38.515
I'm not drunk on it. That's the essence!

00:57:39.615 --> 00:57:41.345

Mr. Lee.

00:57:48.955 --> 00:57:50.055
That was harsh.

00:57:51.294 --> 00:57:52.354
Gosh.

00:57:53.464 --> 00:57:55.495

I don't want to.

00:58:11.374 --> 00:58:13.615

00:58:15.084 --> 00:58:17.185
and stay up all night if you must and proofread it completely.

00:58:17.354 --> 00:58:18.714
I won't teach with that crap.

00:58:19.854 --> 00:58:21.385

01:06:49.865 --> 01:06:51.365
During an after-school class,

01:06:52.265 --> 01:06:54.404
I told the kids to read one book...

01:06:54.834 --> 01:06:56.004
per semester.

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:00.805
I thought no one had taken it seriously.

01:07:03.104 --> 01:07:04.115
But...

01:07:05.645 --> 01:07:07.214
she wrote that over the semester.

01:07:09.845 --> 01:07:11.185
I felt so embarrassed.

01:07:14.685 --> 01:07:17.225
I was ashamed for talking about my beliefs as an educator...

01:07:18.624 --> 01:07:20.865
after being humiliated for fixating on an old-school question.

01:07:22.694 --> 01:07:25.595
And I felt ashamed that a student had listened to me.

01:07:27.135 --> 01:07:28.165
More than anything,

01:07:29.404 --> 01:07:31.004
after all that showing off,

01:07:33.104 --> 01:07:35.245
I had ignored and turned against my students.

01:07:35.645 --> 01:07:36.705
That hit me the most.

01:07:43.115 --> 01:07:46.314
I shouldn't do anything that would make me fall even further.

01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:50.084
Thank you.

01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:01.305
Without looking at your material,

01:08:03.464 --> 01:08:04.975
I will teach as best I can.

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:08.174
I'll study really hard.

01:08:09.404 --> 01:08:10.915
If anyone will take my class,

01:08:12.044 --> 01:08:13.874
I'll pour in all I've got...

01:08:15.944 --> 01:08:17.415
and teach them well.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:20.115
My own way.

01:08:20.714 --> 01:08:22.524
That's what worked for me,

01:08:22.825 --> 01:08:25.055
and I'll teach what worked for me.

01:08:33.034 --> 01:08:34.105
Mr. Pyo.

01:08:35.105 --> 01:08:36.135
Yes.

01:08:36.704 --> 01:08:38.475
Can I ask you to do me a favour?

01:08:39.504 --> 01:08:40.605
Go ahead.

01:08:41.174 --> 01:08:43.004
I'd like you to meet Ms. Woo...

01:08:43.004 --> 01:08:45.275
and take a look at my material.

01:08:46.714 --> 01:08:48.185
Not to use as a reference.

01:08:48.185 --> 01:08:49.284
I'd be grateful...

01:08:50.744 --> 01:08:51.914
if you didn't do that.

01:08:54.754 --> 01:08:55.824
But what?

01:08:56.185 --> 01:08:59.124
But while you're at Choisun Academy,

01:08:59.655 --> 01:09:01.324
you need to become...

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.895
an instructor that no one can touch.

01:09:04.834 --> 01:09:08.265
To do that, I think it would be best if you don't...

01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:10.204
go against Choi Hyung Sun.

01:09:12.004 --> 01:09:14.074
I'll do what I should.

01:09:16.374 --> 01:09:17.374
I will take care of...

01:09:18.414 --> 01:09:19.614
what I must do.

01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:39.534
Isn't that Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:43.334
It is.

01:09:45.235 --> 01:09:47.744
Did you have plans that I got in the way of?

01:09:47.744 --> 01:09:50.244
No, you didn't. Not at all.

01:11:05.655 --> 01:11:07.685
I must bet all I have and fight.

01:11:07.784 --> 01:11:09.225
I think this could ruin you.

01:11:09.324 --> 01:11:11.424
- Are you crazy? - No. I'm perfectly sane.

01:11:11.855 --> 01:11:14.124
Did Ms. Seo approve it?

01:11:14.294 --> 01:11:16.395
We're going to date, aren't we?

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:17.794
Yes.

01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:20.735
Don't think of me as a competitor.

01:11:20.935 --> 01:11:23.265
Try to use them to better yourself.

01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:25.475
Let's not beat around the bush.

01:11:25.674 --> 01:11:28.145
I should leave hand-in-hand with the vice-director.

01:11:28.945 --> 01:11:30.074
Why must it be you?
