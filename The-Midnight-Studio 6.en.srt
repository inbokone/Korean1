00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,980
I wish those hyungnims from work were here, too.

495
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:48,730
But thanks to you, I get to leave behind my footprints that say I was here.

496
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,450
Thank you so much, everyone.

497
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,670
Congratulations on graduating.

498
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,250
Congratulations.

499
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,960
Thank you.

500
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,590
Shall we take the graduation photo now, then?

501
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,100
Yes.

502
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,480
He does great things.

[010-0888-7866]

504
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,830
- Yes.
- Are you out of your mind?

505
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,810
Are you determined to destroy me?

506
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,300
You made me give an honorary degree to a murderer?

507
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,280
Well, what do you mean by that-

508
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,490
Watch the news! Watch it!

509
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,690
I'm canceling the honorary degree.

510
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,850
Wait, excuse me-

511
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,820
Deputy Go, turn on the news.

512
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,030
- News?
- Yes.

513
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,710
It was a major accident with 25 casualties.

514
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,770
The drive who caused the accident also died.

515
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,160
The cause is assumed to be the driver of Haru Delivery falling asleep at the wheel,

516
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,640
but the police are investigating the exact reason.

517
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,800
[The driver was asleep at the wheel due to a heavy workload]
According to the investigation so far,

518
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,680
Driver Yoon expressed he was tired that day.

519
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,610
The heavy workload seems to be the cause.

520
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,100
Haru Delivery stated they followed the legal work hours despite the public's suspicion.

521
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,300
despite the public's assumption.

522
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,570
And since Yoon was contracted as an independent contractor, not an employee,

523
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,720
it was impossible to give excessive orders.

524
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,470
They emphasized that the accident was caused by Yoon's careless driving.

525
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,590
Even so, they feel responsible since the accident occurred while he was on duty

526
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,190
and they expressed regret and remorse toward the victims.

527
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,600
You can't just leave him like this.

528
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,360
Just leave him alone for now.

529
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,040
You don't know what it's like to be denied of your existence.

530
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,320
You're right. I don't.

531
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,290
But what can you do right now?

532
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,910
Will you defend the dead person or something?

533
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,120
[Haru Delivery: Daily Work Log]

534
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,880
Good afternoon.

535
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,990
Do these belong to your company?

536
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,590
They were Mr. Yoon So Myeong's belongings, but he had no family.

537
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,610
Yes, they were So Myeong's.

538
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,380
Got it. Carry on.

539
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,830
[7 hours 40 minutes overtime]
He even wrote down when he got on and off the vehicle and overtime hours, too.

540
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,400
Crazy bastard.

541
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,380
Chief.

542
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,570
We didn't want So Myeong to worry about the undelivered packages even in death,

543
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,010
so we missed his funeral and delivered all of them for him.

544
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,890
But after all that,

545
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:33,600
the company is blaming him for everything instead of defending the poor bastard.

546
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,750
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just sit still.

547
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:43,560
They promised to hire all the drivers full-time as soon as things got sorted out if you sit still.

548
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,520
How long do you want to be an independent contractor?

549
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,900
You're basically a day laborer, aren't you?

550
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,290
Four insurance plans, medical care, and a 52-hour work week.

551
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,860
That's what full-time employment means.

552
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
The evidence is gone now.

553
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,560
The witness also needs to be gone now.

554
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,580
Here's the next story.

555
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,320
In Seoul, many casualties resulted from a collision caused by a delivery truck.

556
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,870
Many innocent citizens became victims of the irreparable tragedy.

557
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:44,110
Unfortunately, more injured victims passed away at the hospital this afternoon.

558
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,630
The cause of the accident is assumed to be the driver falling asleep at the wheel.

559
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,560
One of the victims was a pregnant woman who was due in a week...

560
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,340
I know it's hard to believe, but some ghosts hurt the living.

561
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,040
The accident happened because you were possessed by such a ghost momentarily.

562
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,560
But I did fall asleep.

563
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,220
You steered to the side to save them.

564
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,820
Because I steered to the side,

565
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,330
other people died.

566
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,220
That's...

567
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,740
not entirely your fault.

568
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,080
Don't blame yourself.

569
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,130
Gosh, what do I do?

570
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,650
I feel too terrible.

571
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,680
Because of me...

572
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,930
I'm not saying the visitor is faultless.

573
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:20,160
But he's worked over 70 hours a week for the past six months.

574
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,710
And the company gave him no choice but to do that.

575
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,710
It's unfair for him to take all the blame.

576
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,320
He might be dead, but he shouldn't be punished unfairly.

577
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:38,420
Should I possess the chancellor and undo the cancellation?

578
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,800
No. That's not important right now.

579
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,200
We need to make sure to reveal the truth.

580
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,930
But the visitor doesn't have the time to fight the company.

581
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,400
The time...

582
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,430
How about we try to negotiate, then?

583
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,580
There's this law called the Severe Disaster Punishment Act.

584
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,120
If there was a fatal accident at a workplace because the employer didn't follow safety regulations,

585
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,530
the employer can either serve a year in prison or pay up to one billion won in fines.

586
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,900
There have been industrial disaster cases involving independent contractors, too.

587
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,870
But will that be possible?

588
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,850
We only have a day left.

589
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,510
That's up to one's ability.

590
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,330
Here I am. A very competent attorney who happens to be free.

591
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,730
But we have a major issue.

592
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,420
We need a client who's alive.

593
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,680
Someone to represent the late Mr. Yoon.

594
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,330
I'll try looking for one.

595
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,750
We need someone to accept the case, right?

596
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,920
Okay. We'll be counting on you for that, then.

597
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,720
By the way, who will be paying me for the case?

598
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,740
How much does it cost to hire a very competent attorney?

599
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,720
Grant me a wish, then.

600
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,680
It's as desperate as the ones of the dead.

601
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,440
Excuse me, where's Mr. Jang Cheol Soo?

602
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,780
Excuse me, you're Mr. Jang Cheol Soo, correct?

603
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,660
- Who are you?
- I'm Seo Ki Joo, who called you several times.

604
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,210
We need someone to prove the unfairness of

605
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,120
this case on behalf of the late Yoon So Myeong.

606
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,350
I'm sorry. I don't know much about it.

607
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,560
I need to work. I'm sorry.

608
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,110
- Well, I-
- Why do I have to do stuff like that for him?

609
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,780
I'm busy enough to make a living.

610
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,440
What if I get fired? Will you be responsible?

611
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,390
I don't want to risk my life for someone else. Leave.

612
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,430
You promised to celebrate So Myeong's graduation together.

613
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,370
What's with you, you son of a bitch?

614
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,480
What's going on over there?

615
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,510
I think he came to the wrong place. Don't worry.

616
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,680
We're busy today.

617
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,160
He thinks Jang Seul Woo would be good.

618
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,880
It means "Survive wisely and strongly."

619
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,950
So Myeong said it's his last present for you.

620
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,460
- How did you know-
- Try considering it for...

621
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,600
Seul Woo, not So Myeong.

622
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:41,920
If Seul Woo grows up in a world where you don't fight against injustice,

623
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,250
what kind of injustice will he end up facing?

624
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,080
Look. I'm dying here because I had him late in life.

625
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,340
But I live because of him.

626
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,360
- Did you come up with a name?
- No.

627
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,160
Come up with one since you're smart.

628
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,830
With a name given by a smart and clever uncle like you,

629
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,370
he'll go to a good university like you.

630
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,360
What are you saying? I'm not his uncle.

631
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,600
[Power of Attorney]

632
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,470
- Yes, Honey.
- You must be tired.

633
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,000
No, not at all.

634
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,540
Peanut is resting after a meal now.

635
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,030
Peanut, it's Dad. It's Dad.

636
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,980
Dad.

637
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,110
Dad.

638
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,930
Honey, have you thought about his name?

639

640
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,420
Seul Woo?

641
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,610
It means to be wise and strong.

642
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:06,040
Seul Woo. Jang Seul Woo.

643
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,020
Okay, Jang Seul Woo?

644
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,960
Seul Woo.

645
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:28,090
How come you always take the losing cases that won't pay?

646
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,570
- How impressive.
- Sorting of goods without pay.

647
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,740
Car rental fee. Overtime that's expected every day.

648
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,120
Evidence. Do you have any?

649
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,400
The time sheet says everything was normal.

650
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,090
I see. What is it called? I guess you're talking about the industrial accident.

651
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:51,080

Don't move out.

814
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:10,030
You're going to the Pitcairn Islands in three months, right?

815
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,580
Can I like you until then?

816
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,950
Bom.

817
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,730
Don't interrupt me.

818
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,330
I'm embarrassed because I've been rejected once already.

819
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:30,240
I've been thinking about what kind of relationship we have.

820
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:36,350
You said the people with no tomorrow come to the studio, right?

821
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:41,840
Let's always see each other tomorrow, then.

822
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:47,080
"Bye. Take care. Be well."

823
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:51,460
That's all you say at your studio.

824
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,610
So why don't we always see each other tomorrow?

825
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,150
We'll face a lot of dangers from now on,

826
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:05,920
but let's promise we'll always see each other tomorrow, at least.

827
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:12,740
Go ahead and accept.

828
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,940
Put a seal on.

829
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,760
Make a copy.

830
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:52,020
♫ Do you think we met by coincidence? ♫

831
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:59,190
♫ No, I think it was meant to be ♫

832
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:06,030
♫ If I get to meet you again after a long detour ♫

833
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:12,570
♫ I'll hug you without a word ♫

834
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:20,740
♫ My careless love caused you pain ♫

835
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:27,180
♫ As long as I have you, I don't mind a long detour ♫

836
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,670
Sign.

837
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,680
See you tomorrow, Mr. Seo.

838
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,290
♫ You're the one person who loved me ♫

839
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:49,040
♫ Even if you change your mind after time passes ♫

840
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,900
♫ I'll love you even more ♫

841
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:58,600
♫ Please just be by my side ♫

844
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,450
Why did we have to live in the same building?

845
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,340
How could he be so clueless?

846
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,550
You mean you'll start a business at my business site?

- Don't come!

848
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:25,190
Not all visitors who come here tell only the truth.

They say you become an evil spirit if you have a lot of regrets.

850
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:33,560
Take a photo while I'm asking nicely.

851
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,730
The photographer must like this woman.

852
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:39,360
I saved you.
