Wow. What would you have done without us?

There are two ways.

Either I wake up and open it,

I'll come with you, then.

Oh, hello. I'm Lee Seon Ho, the detective who's in charge of Seo Ki Joo's case.

You said you were off duty today.

A case came up. Detectives should never be off duty.

360

I wanted to ask Ms. Han something, too.

Okay.

362

Is there someone who might've resented Mr. Seo recently?

363
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,430
Maybe he had a fight, lent or borrowed money from someone.

364

I don't know.

Did you narrow down suspects?

No. I haven't even found out the apartment number yet.

368

The CCTV was off before the incident for some reason.

It'd take some time to look through each apartment.

he said someone should be protecting you.

What if he ends up like my grandma-

390

Bom, do you know why I suddenly quit the job I was happy with

391
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,400
and went on a trip on my own?

494
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,250
I can't touch you in front of me,

495
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,710
and I can't catch Lee Seon Ho, who tried to kill me.

496
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,560
There's one thing you can do.

497
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,240
Help me fall asleep.

498
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,900
Mr. Seo.

499
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,680
Why do you think the evil spirit wants the camera so badly?

500
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,410
What's so great about it that he's killing people for it?

501
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,500
I've been thinking about that.

502
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,430
I don't think the camera just photographs the dead.

503
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,450
Just like how Seo Nam Gook saved his mother and son

504
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:04,050
and Uncle's wish saved you,

505
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,780
the evil spirit must've been looking for the camera

506
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,930
for a hundred years because he has a wish like that.

507
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,470
You know that curse?

508
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,330
If you catch the evil spirit and live past your birthday,

509
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,300
will the curse be lifted and you'd be able to live?

510
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,020
I don't know.

511
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,360
No one lived past their 35th birthday yet.

512
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,300
The evil spirits might keep visiting me after my 36th birthday

513
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,590
and I might not wake up even after destroying the evil spirit.

514
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,810
But I won't think about that yet.

515
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,640
I'll think about it later.

516
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Right now, I'll only think about my birthday party with you.

517
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,260
I'm only waiting for that day.

518
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,720
I'll make sure to do that for you.

519
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,200
I'll get you a cake

520
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,430
and sing happy birthday to you.

521

I'll invite Deputy Go, Mr. Baek, and Ji Won.

Hey! Yes, how have you been?

542
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,510
Of course, I've been well.

543
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,720
- My leg! Gosh!
- Na Rae, are you okay?

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,340
- Hello? Na Rae.
- Ahjumma, watch where you're going!

545
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,560
Are you okay?

546
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,250
This lady ran toward me without looking ahead

547
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,400

What will you do?

551
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,070
Sir, your shoelace came undone, and you tripped on your leg.

You fell on my cart. I'm the victim.

Wow, this lady doesn't understand the law at all.

Ahjumma, my body is my asset.

I can't settle with you!

He keeps insisting like this. How long do I have to be here?

He's impossible to talk to.

If he calls again, give him my phone number.

Why do you keep helping me?

You should give up now if I've been ignoring your calls.

Doesn't this situation feel familiar?

- What do you mean-
- Kim Yoon Cheol.

Oh, right. I issued a warrant.

644
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,380
Because you'd likely run away.

Here's the story.

00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:43,210
You've been obsessing over the case that got you fired as a prosecutor.

649
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:48,150
So, you've been clinging onto Kim Seong Soo, the only lead for the case.

So, you ended up getting into a fight with him,

and you ended up killing him.

652

And you concluded the case as a suicide.
