Just an hour, I said.

530
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,000
Hello, Ms. Jang.

531
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,840
- What's this?
- Mr. Park Seong Joon sent me.

532
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,520
He wants to take a photo with you.

533
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,540
What are you? A reporter? A prosecutor?

534
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,090
Mr. Park Seong Joon saw it that day.

535
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,830
That day?

536
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:00,270
You decided to kill your husband that day.

537
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,680
But you must've been afraid...

538
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,890
to kill someone you love with your own hands.

539
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,950
In the end, you failed to be completely cruel.

540
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:44,220
Then, Mr. Park passed away after you ran away from the ward.

541
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,620
How did you know-

542
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,810
When you die, you need to walk the death's path to enter the netherworld.

543
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,640
The path takes your memory from this world one by one.

544
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,450
Starting the moment you were born. In chronological order.

545
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,590
- Pardon?
- If you give up like this now,

546
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:07,460
his last memory will be his wife trying to kill him.

547
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,290
Do you really want that to be his last memory of you?

548
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,590
Your husband said he doesn't mind it.

549
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,270
Are you absolutely certain that she didn't kill you?

550
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,320
Whether she killed me or not...

551
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,020
is not my concern.

552
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,140
I just want my Bo Ra...

553
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,620
to become finally happy.

554
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,790
He said he just wants his memory to be of you.

555
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,510
The moment we get to say goodbye to our loved ones.

556
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,860
We call that a miracle.

557
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,950
Will you waste a miracle like this? At a place like this?

558
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,820
Your husband is waiting for you.

559
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,420
Who are you?

560
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,830
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

561
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,330
Detective.

562
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,110
I'm glad you're here. Can I visit Ms. Jang?

563
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:22,420
Hey, Attorney Han. Ms. Jang had seen her attorney earlier.

564
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,860
- Who?
- Attorney Han Bom.

565
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,100
- That's me.
- Yes.

566
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,910
What?

567
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,350
What am I doing here? Shit.

568
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,690
Bo Ra.

569
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,780
W-What's wrong?

570
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,490
Bo Ra.

571
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:46,860
Let go of him.

572
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,950
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

573
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,680
What are you two?

574
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,990
Are you in this together?

575
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,450
I said I'll be punished quietly!

576
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:01,390
Bo Ra, take a deep breath. Calm down.

577
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,490
Excuse me, are you an attorney?

578
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,880
I'm in charge of Ms. Jang's case. Who are you?

579
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,770
I'm just a proxy.

580
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,730
I send the struggling people to a good place.

581
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,070
Pardon?

582
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,080
White rice and soybean stew full of pollack roe.

583
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,050
He said he'll make them and wait for you.

584
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,660
How do you know-

585
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,110
I'll make white rice and soybean stew full of pollack roe and wait for you.

586
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,820
I'll be right back.

[Seo Ki Joo]

588
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,060
There's only one chance.

589
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,460
Keep that in mind.

590
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,520
You said you're an attorney, right?

591
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,650
Go ahead and prove your skills.

592
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:52,440
My visitor doesn't have a lot of time.
[Photographer Seo Ki Joo]

593
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,110
Wait, excuse me.

594
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:00,320
Excuse me, where are you going? Why did you suddenly bring up rice?

595
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,450
Bo Ra, why did you put socks on him?

596
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:30,530
Even when you had a caretaker, you didn't let them touch his socks.

597
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:35,050
You always changed his socks whenever his doctor made his rounds.

598
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,560
As if someone was watching.

599
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,560
Mr. Park injured his feet in a fire seven years ago.

600
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,300
It's because you don't want people to see the scar, right?

601
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,870
Bo Ra...

602
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:06,050
I don't think someone who cares that much

603
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,690
about his feet and loves him so much

604
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,550
could have killed him.

605
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,490
I received...

606
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,110
I received too many texts.

607
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,820
Even on the day Oppa collapsed from overworking

608
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,240
I said I'd cook him dinner...

609
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,700
with a big smile. I hated myself for that.

611

00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,500

619
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,680
No.

620
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,620
I killed him.

621
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,610

623

The autopsy will determine it anyway,

625
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,220
but you need to say it yourself

626
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:42,700
so you could say goodbye to Mr. Park in time.

627
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,590
Bo Ra, could you testify again?

628
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,710
Yes.

629
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,960
This camera allows you to take only two shots.

630
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,070
The first shot allows the living and the dead...

631

- Who are you...
- to meet each other.

01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,000
What's this?

710
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,350
Did someone move in?

711
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:26,770
Why did they leave the boiler on? What a waste of electricity.

712
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,850
What's this?

713
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,650
Has there always been a space like this?

714
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,380
What's this?

715
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,730
What's...

716
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,300
with you?

717
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:11,370
What is this place?

718
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,860
Are you...

719
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,420
dead?

720
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,390
♫ Never reaching what I want out of life ♫

721
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,380
♫ They keep watching me without something in mind ♫

722
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,670
♫ You're hilarious, precarious ♫

[The Midnight Studio] 💞 @ kissasian.one

724
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,970
How could a living person enter through the gate of the dead?

725
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:59,710
I've never seen anyone for the 20 years I've run the studio. Not even one.

726
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,800
Are they in business or not?

727
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,680
What's with you?

728
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,720
Stop it!

729
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,120
Stop moving!

730
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,370
Do you see him?

731
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,330
You have seen ghosts ever since you were a kid?

732
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,120
I need you.

733
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:20,790
I want you to protect me just for a hundred days.
