00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,929
Your assignments were graded. Take your notebooks.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,059
What?

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,128
- Give us our notebooks. - I want my notebook.

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,129
- Get me mine. - Thank you.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,469
- That's yours, Ye Ji. - That's mine.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,539
- That's mine. - That's yours.

15
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,839
- Could you hand them out? - Sure, I'll do that.

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,979
- Thanks. - Sure.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,199
During career counseling,

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,960
I heard that Jae Min was bullying Yi Heon.

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,999
So when I looked into this,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,740
I found out that in the past two years,

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,098
Yi Heon was absent and late to school quite often.

22
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,139
He was gloomy as well.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,540
Overall, it seemed he had a hard time in school.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,540
So could you do me a favor?

25
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,578
Since you were in the same class with him last year...

26
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,848
and the other kids listened to you...

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,719
because you were the student government president,

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,790
if Jae Min bullies Yi Heon again, could you stop him?

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,900
Let's finish this, you and me.

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,769
That's the only way I'll ever face Yi Heon.

31
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,340
What kind of nonsense is that?

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,359
My guess is that whenever Yi Heon was picked on,

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,189
he didn't tell anyone. He just put up with it.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,500
I mean, just look at him. He looks so innocent.

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,359
I'm sure he's too softhearted to kill a bug even.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,830
Isn't that Song Yi Heon?

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,870
What are you guys doing?

38
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,269
Stop that right now!

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll be downstairs right away. Stay right there!

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,650
Se Kyung. You should go back to the classroom.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,520
If I need you, I'll call you again.

42

(Episode 3)

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,319
Hey, let's bolt before the homeroom teacher gets here.

46
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,189
Don't do that.

47
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,159
There's a saying like this.

48
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,229
"One should not defy one's teacher."

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,759
Defy...

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Define the teacher?

51
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,060
What are you talking about? You jerk.

52
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,430
If you curse at me one more time,

53
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,168
I'll bury you alive...

54
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,300
and crush you.

55
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,840
Jae Min. We should go. Okay?

56
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,509
Why should we go? That jerk isn't leaving.

57
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,649
You're here, ma'am.

58
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
What in the world is going on?

59
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,889
How dare you start a fight and beat up another kid?

60
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,459
What do you think you're doing?

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,959
Ma'am. Song Yi Heon told me to punch him first...

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,229
just like last time.

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,489
He even told me himself that he was a gangster.

64
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,500
A gangster?

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,699
Imagine how angry he must have been to say something absurd like that.

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,499
Given everything he's been through, I can understand why he said that.

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Ma'am.

68
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,909
These guys dragged me here when I was minding my business.

69
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,609
It was self-defense.

70
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,779
Hey, you jerk.

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,049
You punched us more than we punched you.

72
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,249
Hey. Do you want to see it?

73
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,378
Should I show her how you punched me? It's right here.

74
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,379
Jae Min.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,020
Had I done exactly what you did to me,

76
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,759
you wouldn't be alive right now.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,560
You guys. Go to the counseling room.

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,959
Yi Heon. Come here. Let's go to the teachers' office.

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,430
- Come here. - Yes, ma'am.

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,138
You must have been through so much over the past years...

81
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,980
that you decided to fight back.

82
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,180
I've heard some things from other kids.

83
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,389
You shouldn't be bullied anymore.

84
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,088
Let's get the DC for SV involved...

85
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,189
and have Jae Min and his friends face the punishment.

86
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,529
Well, ma'am.

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,399
What's DC for SV?

88
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,259
The disciplinary committee for school violence.

89
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,829
On behalf of the students who are exposed to school violence,

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,299
the school investigates the assailants...

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,009
and penalizes them for their wrongdoings.

92
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,838
And the school protects the victims and mediates for them.

93
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,839
It's a school organization.

94
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,480
So...

95
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,980
the school will be punishing the bad students?

96
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,550
I'm not sure if "punish" is an appropriate word to use.

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,519
Anyway, this will help the victim.

98
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,818
Given the track record of Jae Min, he may be expelled...

99
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,959
or face an FT to a different school.

100
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,860
By FT,

101
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,870
do you mean fried tofu? The snack?

102
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,569
No. Not fried tofu. A forced transfer.

103
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm sure the weakest penalty will be a forced transfer.

104
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,219
But I have a question, ma'am.

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,189
If there was a great way to resolve this issue,

106
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,148
how come I've never called...

107
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,060
a hearing with the disciplinary committee?

108
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,959
Well, I'm not sure.

109
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,930
If you're not sure about this, you can think about it.

110
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,800
You should talk to your parents too.

111
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,970
Your parents must be present at the disciplinary hearing.

112
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,879
Today, you should go home, get your wounds treated, and rest.

113
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,379
It will be better not to tell the other kids about this...

114
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,850
until you've made your decision.

115
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,620
Ma'am.

116
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,819
Is it okay for me to talk to Jae Min?

117
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,290
What?

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Sure.

119
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,159
Jae Min must be in the counseling room.

120
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,199
Go ahead.

(Wee Class)

122
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,360
Did you bring it? Let me see.

123
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,329
- Wait. - Come on. What are you doing?

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,639
Thanks.

125
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
- What about you? - Gosh.

126
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,870
You've come a long way.

127
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,910
Hey, cigarettes will damage your bones. Get rid of them.

128
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,649
Hey. Are you guys friends with them?

129
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,550
- No. - No.

130
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,689
Go already. The break is almost over.

131
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,160
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,128
Where do you think you're going?

133
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,699
Who do you think you are? That was my money.

134
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,810
You can start smoking as an adult. You have plenty of time.

135
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,250
Have you really gone bananas?

136
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,350
Have I gone bananas? I'd rather eat those bananas.

137
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,759
Can't you see that I'm doing my best not to start a fight?

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,790
Had you been a year older, I would have crushed you to pieces.

139
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,959
Consider yourself lucky.

140
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,430
All right. On that note,

141
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,199
make a single line and squat down.

142
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,970
Now.

143
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,039
By the way, I hear that the school will call the DC for SV.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,350
You guys seem carefree, taking other students' money.

145
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Hey.

146
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,850
Did we forcefully take your money?

147
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
He's borrowing it.

148
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,120
He said he'd pay it back.

149
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,230
So you guys...

150
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,299
aren't afraid of the disciplinary committee.

151
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,929
He's ridiculous.

152
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,529
I'll be reporting you to the disciplinary committee.

153
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,440
Hey, you saw him beating me up just now, didn't you?

154
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,110
I saw that. He did hit you.

155
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,750
Why request a hearing over that?

156
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,549
Right.

157
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,389
I'll have to beat you up until the very end.

158
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,019
Fine. We won't need the committee.

159
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,159
A student belongs in school.

160
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,029
Why make you transfer out or get you to be expelled?

161
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,799
I'll just keep you by my side and continue to beat you up.

162
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,799
Make sure to come to school tomorrow every day.

163
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,370
Why must I do what you say? Darn it.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,308
Darn it.

165
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,539
Hey, let go of me.

166
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,210
- You little... - Seriously.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,279
Exactly. Why didn't you listen to a grown-up when you had a chance?

168
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,429
Darn it. The spot. He is Song Yi Heon then.

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,860
What's your connection to the Chilsung Gang?

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,428
Did you learn how to fight from Kim Deuk Pal...

171
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:54,570
of the Chilsung Gang?

172
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,038
Why did you change all of a sudden?

173
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,240
Why do you keep hitting us?

174
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,470
Then why did you hit me?

175
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,278
Because you acted like a loser.

176
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,340
A loser?

177
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,179
How?

178
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,549
I doubt that you had any good reason.

179
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,850
So it means I can also beat you up...

180
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,250
when I don't have a good reason for it.

181
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,259
If you start skipping school, get ready to become my dart board.

182
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,059
Right. Delete all the videos of me.

183
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,070
If I see that one more time,

184
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,870
I'll bury you alive. Understood?

185
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,209
Answer me.

186
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,669
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

187
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:37,340
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,049

(Tasks: Stop getting bullied at school.)

193
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,450
So you guys aren't afraid of the disciplinary committee.

194
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,519
"Disciplinary committee." Seriously?

195
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,220
Gosh. It's common for friends to fight from time to time.

196
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,490
Why request a hearing over that?

197
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,139
(Fully stop getting bullied at school, in progress)

198

(Make friends.)

199
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,139
Are you having fun at school?

200
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,110
Is that why you stole someone else's life?

201
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,419
(Make friends.)

Without you,

204
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,659
I would have succeeded as an actor!

205
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,928
Without you,

206
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,500
I could have lived happily!

207

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,069
I'm happy that you're joining us.

213
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,440
Try to be punctual next time.

214
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:47,370
Where were we?

215
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,579
All right. "May turn you into a pessimist."

216
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,909
Someone who always sees the bad side.

217
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,679
Can I see your notes?

218
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,850
Jae Min.

219
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,389
Don't be late to school.

220
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,529
You're distracting me from my studies. Okay?

221
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,149
Give me that. Come on.

222
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,990
Darn it. Let go.

223
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,649
- Give it to me. Okay. - Come on.

224
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,659
Hold on a second.

225
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,529
Darn it. There are only three left.

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,899
Is the underground life calling you?

227
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,480
Hey, stop bullying the other kids.

228
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,619
Besides, even if you skip evening study hall,

229
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,720
come to class during the day.

230
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Answer me.

231
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:16,659
Yes, sir.

232
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,860
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,419
Whenever I see him,

234
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,849
I find myself speaking with honorifics for some reason.

235
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,018
Let's just skip school.

236
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,090
What if he catches us?

237
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,859
Darn it. He might beat us up pretty badly.

238
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,459
We can stop coming to school, then.

239
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,489
What could he do? He's not going to come after us and kill us.

240
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,789
He might really kill us.

241
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,359
Will you keep letting him walk all over us?

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,070
What do you want me to do?

243
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,000
We've got no power.

244
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,070
It looks like the gang must be backing him.

245
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,339
Hey, I heard Song Yi Heon smacked Hong Jae Min's temple...

246
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,908
which knocked him out.

247
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,148
Hey. Hong Jae Min is much taller. That's absurd.

248
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,219
No.

249
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,320
I heard Song Yi Heon was the one who gave the bruise on his face.

250
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,959
Seriously. When he snapped his fingers in the classroom,

251
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,759
Hong Jae Min went to his desk like his underling.

252
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,970
It does look like his shoulders have gotten broader.

253
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,398
Even his gait seems different.

254
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,969
Doesn't he look pretty normal for some reason?

255
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,908
No way. Even so, there's no way he beat up Hong Jae Min.

256
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,009
How could he?

257
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,339
Really?

258
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,379
Then what about the bruise on his face?

259
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,689
(Request for Genetic Testing)

260
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,990
(Name: Song Yi Heon, March 17, 2023)

261
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:52,019
Well, this is a private matter for my friend.

262
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,120
I hope my father won't hear about this.

263
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,888
Since you'll tutor my daughter for math,

264
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,960
I guess I'm in no position to say no.

265
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,028
Well, this is relevant to your friend's personal information.

266
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,268
Even if your father doesn't find out about it,

267
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,869
I'll need other documents...

268
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,299
like your friend's family register and his ID card.

269
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
I'll tell him to get those documents.

270
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,769
Please text me the list. Okay.

271
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,349
So she had a son, right?

272
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,389
His name is Song Yi Heon. He goes to Hansong High School.

273
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,820
From what I hear, he's a tough one.

274
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,329
His name sounds familiar.

275
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,428
I also felt something was off,

276
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,500
so I stared at his photo for a good while.

277
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,470
Well, he's still a kid.

278
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,840
That's Kwangsoo Gang's main turf.

279
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,110
Gather guys with low profiles, so this doesn't become a big thing.

280
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,309
Yes, sir.

281
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
Sir.

282
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,210
Some of our juniors are leaving the gang little by little.

283
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,379
If Deuk Pal had been with us,

284
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,179
he would've taken care of it.

285
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:56,820
What about the chairman?

286
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,418
I told the guys to look for him...

287
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,529
around the places he frequented one at a time.

288
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,599
This is a big case.

289
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,859
Let's do this right,

290
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,630
so we can work for him like in the old days.

291
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,799
Yes, sir. I'll take care of this as soon as possible.

292
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,410
(Hansong High School)

293
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,539
I need some documents from him for the genetic testing.

294
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
(Mr. Jung Won)

295
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,210
(I need his family register and a copy of his ID card.)

296
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,420
That's all you need?

297
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
Yes.

298
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,319
Right. I've been meaning to ask you.

299
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
On the day we went to listen to music,

300
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,559
did your father scold you?

301
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,859
Which friend?

302
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,269
You should have told him that I insisted on going there.

303
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,339
Nothing happened.

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Jae Min.

305
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,519
Come on out.

306
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,589
Darn it. Gosh...

307
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
How did Choi Se Kyung and I...

308
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,670
get along in the past?

309
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,400
You should know better.

310
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,950
I mean, you were the one who stalked him...

311
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,410
like those other screeching girls,

312
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,049
calling him "Student Government President."

313
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,319
How do you think he got along with a stalker like that?

314
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,399
Hey, I'm sorry. I was trying to hit your mouth.

315
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,500
Why, you...

316
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,130
Gosh...

317
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,869
I wasn't stalking him.

318
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,640
I only wanted to be his friend.

319
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,710
You were the one who called it stalking.

320
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm sure you wanted to be friends with Choi Se Kyung...

321
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,449
since he reported the school bullying for you.

322
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,319
But it wasn't the same for that fox, Choi Se Kyung.

323
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,018
That's why he didn't say anything when we called you a stalker.

324
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,519
Because you were really stalking him.

325
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,690
He reported it for me?

326
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,219
But he didn't do anything about the stalking?

327
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,890
Why are you pretending not to remember?

328
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,359
Look at that mammoth acting.

329
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,059
It's not "mammoth."

330
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,869
It's "method."

331
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,129
Whatever.

332
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,568
You also fell for that fox...

333
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,839
because he's from a rich and decent family...

334
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,939
with a prosecutor father and department store CEO mother,

335
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,480
and even has good grades.

336
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,549
He's practically a snake,

337
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,210
and you don't even know it.

338
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,319
But why does he get so heated whenever I mention his family?

339
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,318
They must give him a lot of stretching about studying.

340
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,319
"Stress."

341
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,719
Parents of elite kids...

342
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,890
are only satisfied when their kids are elite.

343
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,329
It sucks.

344
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,769
But he looks content and happy when he's studying.

345
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,969
So what happened...

346
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,539
after he reported the school bullying?

347
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,809
Why am I answering your questions?

348
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,279
I'm leaving.

349
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,910
Do you want to tell me after I hit you?

350
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,250
What do you mean by what happened?

351
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,150
What did we do wrong?

352
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,920
We were only fooling around with you,

353
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,018
and the teacher agreed to call it off.

354
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,420
Even you said that it wasn't school bullying.

355
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,858
You said that you didn't get hit and that we were fooling around,

356
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,119
so why are you doing this?

357
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,598
And you always covered your face with your hair, looking all gloomy,

358
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,329
hunched over like this.

359
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,069
Who would like that?

360
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,400
No one would have noticed if you disappeared.

361
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,439
That's why I tried to keep you company,

362
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,869
but I was reported for school bullying.

363
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,180
Don't you think that's frustrating?

364
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:44,450
Alright, Jae Min.

365
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,019
Let's have fun from now on. Okay?

366
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,269
Gosh...

367
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,039
Kim Deuk Pal!

368
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,970
Why did you have to teach that punk how to fight?

369
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,609
Take your mathematics textbook, and class fees are due today.

370
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,910
I'm going to visit the homes of those who didn't pay.

371
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,680
Maybe I shouldn't pay.

372
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,880
President, come over to my place.

373
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,919
Do you need help handing the textbooks out?

374
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,660
- You always do it yourself. - It's okay, I'll do it.

375
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,329
It doesn't take long.

376
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm sure you wanted to be friends with Choi Se Kyung...

377
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,130
since he reported the school bullying for you.

378
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,869
Is he actually a good kid?

379
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,339
Maybe that's why he was nice to Song Yi Heon.

380
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,409
But it wasn't the same for that fox, Choi Se Kyung.

381
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,940
That's why he didn't say anything when we called you a stalker.

382
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,249
Remember that rainy day?

383
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,619
You came to my house and said you would expose...

384
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,118
my true nature to people...

385
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,750
if I didn't do what you told me to do.

386
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,518
There must have been a reason Song Yi Heon said that to him.

387
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,130
- Good luck with the test tomorrow. - Thanks.

388
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Good luck.

389

(Mathematics)

401
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,279

I'm waiting for a call. Have fun.

405
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,490
Come on...

406
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,390
Yi Heon, what about you?

407
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,160
The coin karaoke. Want to come?

408
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,559
- Let's go. - Let's go.

409
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,630
- Let's go by ourselves. - Bye.

410

Aren't you going?

412
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,549
I should look for a private tutor.

They say you pass with 4 hours of sleep and not 5,

417
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,269

What are you talking about?

421
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,649
- Hey. - What...

422
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,650
In mathematics,

423
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,420
I got everything wrong except for the one you taught me.

424
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,660
You said you wanted to study with me.

425
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,189
Please help me out.

426
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,589
- I think I'll be alright. - Please help me, Choi Se Kyung.

No, I can't.

430
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,730
Choi Se Kyung?

431
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,240
You didn't leave yet?

432
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,970
We played basketball since the exams were over.

433
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,839
What are you doing?

434
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,679
Yi Heon wanted to ask me a favor.

435
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,619
Song Yi Heon? It's him.

436
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,049
Isn't he the stalker...

437
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,750
I heard you go to evening self-study these days.

438
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,430
- Yes. - Then...

439
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,130
why don't we make a math study group during the evening self-study?

440
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:51,859
That sounds good.

441
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,960
There's 1, 2, 3, 4...

442
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,098
- Four is perfect. - It looks like...

443
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,828
they're having fun on their own.

444
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,099
- We should choose a name. - Even a name?

445
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,569
What do you think?

446
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,339
They're not even close to him,

447
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,680
and they just want to study with the top student.

448
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,650
But why is he standing still?

449
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,049
Why are you leaving me out?

450
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,589
Can I be the leader?

451
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,829
I'll do it if Yi Heon is in.

452
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,410
Let's talk about this again...

453
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,480
when we get the chance.

454
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,210
Let's go.

455
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,578
Hey, why is he sitting with the stalker?

456
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:44,650
Maybe he has Stockholm syndrome.

457
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,720
Be quiet. He'll hear.

458
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,960
You reject me all the time.

459
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,529
Why are you standing still in front of them?

460
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,400
Rejecting didn't seem to be the answer.

461
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,299
- What? - They don't care how I feel.

462
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,710
It's just...

463
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,109
like that for me.

464
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,819
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

465
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,849
Learning by teaching.

466
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,489
There has to be learning and teaching...

467
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,359
in order to reinforce each other.

468
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,289
I don't intend on freeloading like those guys.

469
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,589
I'll do whatever...

470
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,359
you want me to do.

471
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,970
"Whatever?"

472
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,309
Go ahead first.

473
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,818
The joke is on you.

474
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,549
I could have killed that.

475
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,229
Don't you think stalkers should...

476
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,430
practice social distancing?

477
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,410
It's new.

478
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,049
- Why don't we play a game? - Hey.

479
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,078
Don't you know that Jae Hoon is the captain...

480
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,220
of the school basketball team?

481
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,720
Is that so?

482
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,749
Then why don't you three, with Jae Hoon, play against me?

483
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,750
One point for each goal,

484
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,920
and whoever gets five points first wins.

485
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,359
What is he saying?

486
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,329
Basketball is what I do best, after soccer.

487
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,699
I was so envious of the kids who played on the court...

488
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,469
that I've practiced ever since my late teenage years,

489
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,269
almost as much as a coach does.

490
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,469
I'm sure there's no way, but if you guys win,

491
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,409
I will convince Choi Se Kyung to do the study group...

492
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,940
no matter what it takes.

493
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,609
But if I win, this basketball...

494
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,579
is mine.

495
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,380
I'll do whatever...

496
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,250
you want me to do.

497
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,289
Song Yi Heon is playing basketball?

498
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,630
- Yi Heon is playing basketball. - Let's go and watch.

499
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,509
Song Yi Heon?

500
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,079
Yes, Mr. Jung Won.

501
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,380
The results are out?

502
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,680
Yes, with Song Mi Sun.

503
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,518
So, Song Yi Heon and his mother...

504
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,819
are a 99.99 percent match.

505
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,089
The two really are related.

506
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,500
If those two are related,

507
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,669
- Gosh. - Yes.

508
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,069
This Song Yi Heon is the real Song Yi Heon that I know?

509
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,779
- Gosh. - Amazing.

510
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,359
People change after a major life event.

511
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,059
People can change.

512
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,509
No one can change that much, no matter what.

513
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,049
- Look at him. - That's amazing.

514
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,650
- That was so cool. - Great.

515
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,390
Have you ever seen me stalking someone?

516
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,159
Do I have to see to know?

517
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,119
You've never seen me, yet you called me a stalker.

518
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,390
Is it because Song Yi Heon is an outcast?

519
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:55,569
Making up rumors behind people's backs...

520
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,900
and insulting and framing others...

521
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,339
is violence...

522
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,569
that can hurt them beyond repair.

523
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,640
You all...

524
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,049
should stop talking behind people's backs and mocking them.

525
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,079
If you keep playing with fire,

526
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,549
you might get pushed into the pit. Understand?

527
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,029
I get to keep the basketball as promised, okay?

528
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,640
Let's do it. I'll study with you.

529
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,710
Just keep your word...

530
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,140
that you'll do whatever I want.

531
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,609
A real man keeps his word.

532
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,279
Let's go to the study room.

533
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,049
Draw out your daily schedule.

534
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,858
Why is this place so empty?

535
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,118
Is it not doing well,

536
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,630
or is it just today?

537
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,460
- I rented the whole place. - I see.

538
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
- With my card? - Yes.

539
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,799
I hate the sound of chairs pulling.

540
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,508
- I hate it. - The whole place?

541
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:11,710
You said you wanted to study.

542
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,910
Don't you want to?

543
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,750
But...

544
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,119
Gosh...

545
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,489
I start with math as soon as I wake up at 5am.

546
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,829
At 7am, I exercise and then go to school.

547
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,359
And as you may know, I really lack in math.

548
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,268
I only study math during evening self-study.

549
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,700
That's why you don't improve no matter how hard you study.

550
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,470
The only choice you have...

551
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,538
is to GU on math.

552
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,539
"GU?"

553
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,980
Is that like a blister?

554
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,180
What is he saying?

555
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,649
Is that the acronym I know?

556
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,119
GU on math.

557
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,848
"Give up on math."

558
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,220
Oh, "give up on math."

559
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,589
"Give up on math?" Is that possible?

560
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,190
Of course not.

561
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,229
It's not,

562
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,729
but we're already seniors,

563
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,630
and you don't have time to hold on to it.

564
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,199
You need to have a total average of Grade Three...

565
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,410
in order to get in Seoul.

566
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,670
Hey...

567
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,009
I have some decency, you know.

568
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,250
I don't expect to get into Seoul University.

569
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,920
You don't know the meaning of "in Seoul?"

570
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,660
Fine.

571
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,729
Even if you give up on math,

572
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,959
you need to bring up the grades of other subjects...

573
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,730
that require memorizing and languages.

574
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,569
That's if you want to go to college for a decent life like you said.

575
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,369
Okay.

576
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,400
Take out your English textbook first.

577
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,369
Why, you little...

578
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,240
Gosh...

579
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,609
I stayed up all night these few days for the exams,

580
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:27,809
so I'm exhausted.

581
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,480
I should go for a walk.

582
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,289
Why did you buy this?

583
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,829
Even my uncle doesn't drink this these days.

584
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,500
(Oriental Raisin Tea)

585
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,829
Drink this. It's nutty.

586
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,599
Weren't there any sodas or soy milk?

587
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,509
There wasn't any soy milk,

588
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,640
and sodas rot your teeth.

589
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,240
Gosh.

590
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,779
Here. Drink this.

591
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,680
It's my favorite.

592
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,289
Now go on and tell me.

593
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,158
You agreed to help me with my studies...

594
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,730
only when I said that I would do whatever you wanted.

595
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,130
So go on and tell me, and I will do it.

596
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,769
You really are sharp.

597
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,339
You don't let anything slide, except for your grades.

598
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,400
Why, you...

599
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,579
I'm doing my best to think of what to choose.

600
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:37,179
Sure, think about it and tell me.

601
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,218
Oh, and I was always curious...

602
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,989
but had no one to ask.

603
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,090
The school violence committee seemed like a good system,

604
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,289
so why is it useless?

605
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,389
Because it's held inside the school.

606
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,558
There are too many things to consider.

607
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,058
The dignity of the school, the power of the parents,

608
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,230
and things like that.

609
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,529
If you want punishment,

610
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,469
it's better to take it to the police.

611
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,509
That way, the assailant will be scared...

612
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,309
to have his records follow him forever.

613
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,679
But if the assailant also sues the victim,

614
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,019
then it could get messy.

615
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,789
And there may not be proper punishment.

616
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
What kind of law protects the assailant?

617
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,059
Then what is the best punishment?

618
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:31,829
Just kill him.

619
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,969
Neither the school nor the law can punish the assailant,

620
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,909
and there is no way for the victim to protect himself.

621
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,150
Most victims leave the school and hide away from the world.

622
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,349
And if it's still too much, they end up committing suicide.

623
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,289
Nothing will change when you're dead.

624
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:55,058
So, just kill him.

625
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,889
Get as much evidence as you can...

626
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,360
for an extenuation.

627
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,969
That's the best thing you can do to live in a world without him.

628
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,070
It's the only choice you have to protect yourself.

629
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,739
Is this what he really is like?

630
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Is this the true nature of Choi Se Kyung?

631
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,949
Let's go back. We're taking too much rest.

632
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,959
(Hansong High School)

633
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,570
Hey, Yi Heon. What's with you?

634
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:37,868
Is it true that you took...

635
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,440
Lee Jae Hoon's basketball after playing a 1-on-3 match?

636
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,639
- Are you talking about this? - Goodness.

637
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,109
I'm playing again against Jae Hoon's class tomorrow.

638
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,209
Is there anyone who wants to join me?

639
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,609
- Me. - Me too.

640
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,809
- Song Yi Heon. - Song Yi Heon.

641
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,380
- Song Yi Heon. - Song Yi Heon.

642
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,488
By the way, do any of you like to play soccer?

643
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,589
Are you good at soccer too?

644
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,920
Hey. Compared to my soccer skills, my basketball skills are nothing.

645
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,828
Why have you been hiding your skills?

646
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,460
We got beaten in soccer the other day.

647
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,900
Hey, Se Kyung.

648
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,099
We'll get our revenge, thanks to Yi Heon.

649
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,170
That's good.

650
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,340
Yi Heon, you had been a loser hiding your real power.

651
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:15,969
Why have you been hiding it?

652
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,610
Guys, let's play soccer during the lunch break.

653
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,279
- Sure. - I love that idea.

654
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,780
- I'll buy you something to drink. - Seriously.

655
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,949
Guys, sit down.

656
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,179
I have your temporary report cards.

657
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,119
The report card!

658
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,689
(Don't throw away your report cards. Show it to your parents!)

659
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,629
(Have a good weekend.)

660
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,760
Others called you a loser hiding his real power.

661
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,760
But you're just a real loser when it comes to study.

662
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,300
How dare you...

663
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,940
For the first time in my life, I realized a variety of numbers...

664
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,269
could be on a report card, thanks to you.

665
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,510
Hey, all report cards are the same.

666
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,110
Is the report card of a top student any different?

667
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,719
Hey.

668
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,429
It's as if this report card was written in a binary system.

669
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,260
All I see is either a 0 or a 1.

670
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,929
That's why you should stop dozing off and study harder.

671
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,340
I can't go on like this.

672
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,210
Let's grab a drink before heading to the study room.

673
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,530
I knew it.

674
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,469
It somehow felt weird in my head.

675
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:54,369
I thought it was a soda.

676
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,449
(Pineapple)

677
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,650
- Thank you. - Sure.

678
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,489
I bought this for you and Yi Heon.

679
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,789
You could've come empty-handed to your friend's house.

680
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,059
Oh, no.

681
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,230
It's a shame when you bought it for us.

682
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,869
But Yi Heon can't have a fruit cake like this one.

683
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,469
He's allergic to pineapple.

684
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:32,639
His throat swells up with even the smallest piece of pineapple.

685
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,178
I heard he had a terrible incident when he was young.

686
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,579
He almost died.

687
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:45,150
Put it in the basket if you want it.

688
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:46,719
Everything is on me today.

689
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,559
Hey, that's...

690
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,199
Gosh. On days like this,

691
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,069
I want to have soju...

692
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,869
and clotted ox blood soup with tripe and intestine.

693
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,809
I want whiskey on the rocks with cheese too.

694
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,610
Or chilled beer with dried snacks.

695
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,980
You know about the drinks quite well.

696
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,879
Did you drink often?

697
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,090
I'm just saying they might pair nicely.

698
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,289
I think those are good food pairings.

699
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,429
You can have it if you want to.

700
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:35,500
Have some.

701
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,269
That's the favor I want to ask you.

702
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,340
You want me...

703
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,710
to eat this cake?

704
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
Yes.

705
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,239
I knew it.

706
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,070
Using that Do Anything card, isn't worth using on this cake, right?

707
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,110
Is it all you could come up with...

708
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,579
after giving it deep thought?

709
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,489
(Pudding)

710
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:27,789
Hey.

711
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,860
Is it okay for you to eat this?

712
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,730
Why? Do you want to eat that too?

713
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,099
Hey. My throat is...

714
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,840
I can't breathe.

715
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,309
Hey, Yi Heon.

716
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,179
Hey, get up.

717
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,880
Are you all right? Yi Heon.

718
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,619
Are you okay?

719
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,789
Hey.

720
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,429
The swelling has subsided.

721
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,170
They said you can go home now.

722
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,010
What is this all about?

723
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,309
Yi Heon is allergic to pineapples.

724
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,880
Were you trying to kill me?

725
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,349
You ate it yourself.

726
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,889
If you are indeed Yi Heon suffering from memory loss,

727
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,630
others would tell you about it.

728
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,259
The housekeeper said that was the first thing...

729
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,860
she was told when she started working at your place.

730
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,030
That you shouldn't have pineapples. That it could kill you!

731
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,199
Why did nobody tell you that this time?

732
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,110
Because everyone thinks you're Song Yi Heon.

733
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,309
Because what you said about memory loss is a lie!

734
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,389
I don't know why the test result said you were Yi Heon.

735
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,489
But you are not Yi Heon.

736
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,869
Could you help me?

737
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,300
I know you can help me.

738
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,440
Why would I meddle in your business?

739
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,449
Please help me.

740
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,510
I'm begging you.

741
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,150
After sending Yi Heon away from my place,

742
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,289
I couldn't sleep for days because of the anxiety and pain.

743
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,360
I finally got his number and called, but he didn't pick up.

744
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,170
When he even skipped classes over the vacation,

745
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,400
I got more anxious.

746
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,969
The teacher told us he couldn't come because he was sick.

747
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,440
I wondered if he got hurt because of me.

748
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:05,150
Or if something happened to him.

749
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,250
I couldn't sit still.

750
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,949
Sorry about that.

751
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,019
I really didn't think...

752
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,229
it was you at the bookstore.

753
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,460
- "Song Yi Heon." - I'm here, ma'am.

754
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:20,530
But since I met you in school...

755
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,030
and realized you were not him,

756
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,900
I haven't been able to breathe.

757
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,570
It really felt like I was going crazy.

758
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,880
I am so scared...

759
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,480
that he might be dead because of me.

760
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,719
You.

761
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,860
What did you do to Yi Heon?

762
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,559
I didn't want to get hurt.

763
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,488
Part of it is your fault.

764
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,530
No.

765
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,599
It's all your fault.

766
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,369
So, I treated him more coldly and brutally.

767
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,079
So, just kill him.

768
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,909
It's the only choice you have to protect yourself.

769
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,929
Are you saying you want to apologize to him?

770
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,599
Okay.

771
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,210
I'll make sure you'll meet him. You can apologize to him then.

772
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,480
He'll be back. I'll make that happen.

773
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,380
When will that be?

774
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,670
Sometime in the future.

775
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,940
He might return faster if you help me.

776
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,979
Until then, you have to help me...

777
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,780
so he can come back safely and live a proper life...

778
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,579
after he comes back.

779
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,179
Help me with studying.

780
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,049
As I told you before,

781
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,949
one has to go to college to function as a human being.

782
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
You're not lying,

783
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,789
are you?

784
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,599
Do you think I'm the type of person who lies?

785
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,039
I'll do it. I'll help you.

786
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,940
In return, you have to bring him back.

787
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:45,940
Bring Song Yi Heon back.

788
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,449
He's not dead. Don't worry.

789
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,780
So,

790
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,579
you should do your best to help me study.

791
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:01,420
I might be worse at it than you think.

792
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,400
I know.

793
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,769
(Reading, Korean History, Physics, Earth Science, English, Math)

794
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,379
As for math, aim to get just the basic questions.

795
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,510
Solve those questions over and over again.

796
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,420
You have to raise your score in other subjects.

797
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,320
Focus on the subjects that require memorization.

798
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,929
(Reading, Korean History, Physics, Earth Science, English, Math)

799
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:45,969
Hey, Se Kyung.

800
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,909
Which one?

801
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,440
Which question?

802
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,980
"In the figure below..."

803
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,199
"Observatory."

804
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,130
"Flight."

805
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,940
"Flight."

806
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,670
"Panic."

807
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,119
He's in a good place now.

808
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:44,489
I guess so.

809
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,559
Yes. Okay.

810
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,469
Boss, they're almost here.

811
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,940
Why are those punks sitting there?

812
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,079
They are kids from this neighborhood.

813
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,578
They are sitting out there all day asking for a job.

814
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,149
If so, they should have come earlier.

815
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,718
I can't focus on my work at all because of them.

816
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,050
Boss, didn't you say you were out of cigarettes?

817
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,119
- I'll go and buy them. - Okay.

818
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,360
Those punks.

819
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,888
I told you not to stay here.

820
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,559
Well, come here.

821
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,070
A clear sky.

822
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,670
I want to see it too.

823
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,309
I told you not to sit around here.

824
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:32,969
Look at the color of this punk's hair.

825
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,579
Gosh.

826
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:39,449
Should I ask him...

827
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,420
- about Kim Deuk Pal? - Do you really intend to find him?

828
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,150
That punk learned how to fight from him.

829
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,860
So, I want to learn from him too.

830
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,019
Do as you please.

831
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,328
Who learned how to fight from Deuk Pal?

832
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,500
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

833
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,869
There's a crazy guy in our class.

834
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,238
He said he learned how to fight from Chilsung Gang's Kim Deuk Pal.

835
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,400
It just can't be true.

836
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:05,570
The Chilsung Gang doesn't exist anymore.

837
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,880
When Deuk Pal was alive, he could be overly generous.

838
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,710
I guess his path crossed with that kid too.

839
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,619
- Which school do you go to? - Hansong High School.

840
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:16,749
We're graduating soon.

841
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,119
We'll join you after graduation, so please give us a job.

842
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,129
At your school, is there someone named Song...

843
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,730
What are you doing, you punks?

844
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:31,500
Gosh.

845
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,738
Why did you step out of the car?

846
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,539
I was going to take care of them myself.

847
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,238
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

848
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,879
Is that so hard to understand?

849
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,940
Is that so hard?

850
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:46,679
They're here.

851
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:49,519
Okay. Let's go.

852
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,389
Don't come here. Okay?

853
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,868
- I'm sorry, sir. - What is it?

854
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:12,009
One of us got arrested by the police not long ago.

855
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,409
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

856
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,948
Boss, what if I go with them?

857
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:21,118
We just need one person in the van to guard it.

858
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,819
You punk! The Kwangsoo Gang knows who you are.

859
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,989
Are you going to take responsibility if something happens?

860
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,960
Hey. The one in green. Come here.

861
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,469
- Hurry. - Yes, sir.

862
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,610
You guys do the work.

863
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,980
Make him watch from the van.

864
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,750
You're lucky today.

865
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:53,480
Where are we going?

866
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:54,849
Would you know even if I told you?

867
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,420
We're going to go and make money.

868
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:00,090
Get in.

869
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,690
Hurry up and get in.

870
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,538
Hey, which one is correct here?

871
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,639
Is it "a" or "the?"

872
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:19,010
Hey. We went over this yesterday.

873
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,139
I know.

874
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:23,210
But articles are so tricky.

875
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,449
Darn it.

876
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:32,820
It doesn't have a license plate.

877
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,690
Excuse me.

878
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,089
Why did you cancel the police report?

879
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,419
We have to find out who did it and catch the perps.

880
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,928
If the police get involved,

881
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:12,859
Yi Heon's life will change drastically.

882
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,900
That won't be good for Yi Heon at all.

883
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,530
I'm sorry.

884
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:20,098
I found out through a detective I know...

885
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:22,969
that the police report had already been retracted.

886
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:26,210
I promise to get everything straightened out.

887
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,779
They come occasionally when we sit around...

888
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,249
in front of Sinho Nightclub at Sinho Hotel downtown.

889
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,849
They are gangsters!

890
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,819
I know nothing...

891
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,849
other than they are part of the Dongsoo Gang.

892
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:37,789
Dong Soo.
